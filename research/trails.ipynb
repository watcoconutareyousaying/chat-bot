Without \\nan adequate vocabulary, we can neither \\nunderstand others nor make ourselves understood. \\nDefinitions and explanations of terms used in descriptive \\ntooth morphology are the basic foundation for under-\\nstanding subject matter presented in subsequent chap-\\nters of this text. You need to learn some basics, similar \\nto learning a foreign language. You will soon become \\nfamiliar with these dental terms as you continue to use \\nthem throughout your professional dental career.\\nNAMING TEETH BASED ON LOCATION WITHIN THE NORMAL, \\nCOMPLETE HUMAN DENTITIONSECTION I\\nThis section is designed to introduce you to terms used \\nwhen naming teeth based on their normal location in \\nthe mouth. All of the teeth in the mouth together are \\nreferred to as the dentition [den TISH un]. Humans \\nhave two dentitions throughout life: one during child-\\nhood, called the primary dentition , and one that will \\nhopefully last throughout adulthood, called the per-\\nmanent (also known as secondary) dentition. The \\nteeth in the upper jawbones (called the maxillae [mak \\nSIL ee]) collectively form an arch shape known as the \\nmaxillary [MACK si lair ee] arch, and those teeth in \\nthe lower jawbone (called the mandible) collectively \\nform the mandibular [man DIB yoo ler] arch. Each \\narch can further be divided into the left and right \\nhalves (also known as left and right quadrants since \\neach quadrant contains one fourth of all teeth in that \\ndentition).\\nA. COMPLETE PRIMARY DENTITION\\nThe complete primary dentition is normally present in \\na child from the ages of about two to six years. There \\nare 20 teeth in the entire primary dentition (shown in \\nFig. 1-1): ten in the upper maxillary arch and ten in the \\nlower mandibular arch. This dentition is also called \\nthe deciduous [de SIDJ oo us] dentition, referring to \\nthe fact that all of these teeth are eventually shed by \\nage 12 or 13, being replaced sequentially by teeth of \\nthe permanent dentition. The complete primary den-\\ntition has five teeth in each quadrant. The primary \\nteeth in each quadrant are further divided into three \\nclasses: incisors [in SI zerz], canines, and molars. \\nBased on location, starting on either side of the mid-\\nline between the right and left quadrants, the two \\nfront teeth in each quadrant of the primary dentition \\nare incisors (I), followed by one canine (C), then two \\nmolars (M). Using these abbreviations for the classes \\nof teeth, followed by a ratio composed of a top number \\nrepresenting the number of teeth in each upper quad-\\nrant and the bottom number representing the number \\nof teeth in each lower quadrant, a  formula can be used \\nto represent the teeth in the human  primary dentition \\nas follows:\\n=21 2\\n21 2C M 5 upper and 5 lower teeth in each \\n quadrant; 20 teeth in all\\nI\\nThe classes of primary teeth containing more than \\none tooth per quadrant (incisors and molars) are sub-\\ndivided into types within each class. Each type can \\nalso be identified by its location within the complete \\nquadrant. The primary incisor closest to the mid-\\nline separating the right and left quadrants is called \\na central incisor . The incisor next to, or lateral to, \\nthe central incisor is called a lateral incisor . Next in \\neach quadrant is a canine, followed by two types of \\nmolars: a first molar  behind the canine and then a \\nsecond molar.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nUsing either models of the complete primary \\n dentition or Figure 1-1 while covering up the \\nlabels, identify each primary tooth based on its \\nlocation in the arch. Include, in order, the denti-\\ntion, arch, quadrant (right or left), type (when \\napplicable), and class. For example, the tooth \\nnext to the midline in the lower left quadrant \\nwould be identified as the primary mandibular \\nleft central incisor.\\nB. COMPLETE PERMANENT DENTITION\\nThe complete permanent (or secondary) dentition is \\npresent in the adult. It is composed of 32 teeth: 16 in \\nthe upper maxillary arch and 16 in the lower mandibu-\\nlar arch (shown in Fig. 1-2). The permanent dentition \\nhas eight teeth in each quadrant, which are divided into'),\n",

Continuing around \\ntoward the back in each quadrant are three molars: a \\nfirst molar, a second molar, and finally a third molar \\n(sometimes referred to as a wisdom tooth).\\nAs noted by comparing the formulas for primary \\nand permanent teeth, differences exist. Although cen-\\ntral and lateral incisors and canines are similarly posi-\\ntioned in both dentitions, permanent dentitions have \\na new category of teeth called premolars, which are \\nlocated between canines and molars. Premolars are \\npositioned in the spaces left where the primary molars \\nwere located earlier in life.

To do so expedi-\\ntiously , it is necessary to adopt a type of code or num-\\nbering system for teeth. Otherwise, for each tooth being \\ncharted, one must write something like “maxillary right \\nsecond molar mesio-occlusodistal amalgam restora-\\ntion with a buccal extension” (11 words, or 81 letters). \\nSimplified by using the Universal Numbering System \\n(and other standard abbreviations to denote tooth \\nrestoration surfaces described later in Chapter 10), \\nthis same information would be “2MODBA” (only six \\nsymbols).\\nThe Universal Numbering System  was first sug-\\ngested by Parreidt in 1882, and officially adopted by the \\nAmerican Dental Association in 1975. It is accepted by \\nthird-party providers and is endorsed by the American \\nSociety of Forensic Odontology . Basically , the Universal \\nNumbering System uses No. 1 through 32 for the \\n32 teeth in the permanent dentition, starting with 1 \\nfor the maxillary right third molar, going around the \\narch to the maxillary left third molar as 16; dropping \\ndown on the same side, the left mandibular third molar \\nbecomes 17, and then the numbers increase around the \\nlower arch to 32, which is the lower right third molar. \\nThis numbering system is used for each permanent \\ntooth in the illustration in Figure 1-3.\\nFor the 20 teeth in the primary dentition, 20 letters \\nof the alphabet are used from A through T. The letter \\nA represents the maxillary right second molar, sequen-\\ntially around the arch and through the alphabet to J for \\nthe maxillary left second molar, then dropping down \\non the same side to K for the mandibular left second \\nmolar, and then clockwise around the lower arch to T \\nfor the mandibular right second molar. This system is \\nused to identify each primary tooth in the illustration \\nin Figure 1-4.\\nThere are also two other numbering systems, the \\nPalmer Tooth Notation System, and the World Dental \\nFederation (International) System used in other coun-\\ntries.

FOUR TISSUES OF A TOOTH\\nThe tooth is made up of four tissues: enamel, dentin, \\ncementum, and pulp. The first three of these (enamel, \\ndentin, and cementum) are relatively hard since they \\ncontain considerable mineral content, especially cal-\\ncium (so these tissues can also be described as calci-\\nfied). Only two of these tissues are normally visible in \\nan intact extracted tooth: enamel and cementum. The \\nother two tissues (dentin and pulp) are usually not vis-\\nible on an intact tooth. Refer to Figure 1-6 while read-\\ning about each tissue.\\nEnamel [ee NAM el] is the white, protective external \\nsurface layer of the anatomic crown. It is highly cal-\\ncified or mineralized, and is the hardest substance in \\nthe body. Its mineral content is 95% calcium hydroxy-\\napatite (which is calcified). The remaining substances \\ninclude 5% water and enamel matrix. It develops from \\nthe enamel organ (ectoderm) and is a product of spe-\\ncialized epithelial cells called ameloblasts [ah MEL o \\nblasts].\\nCementum [se MEN tum] is the dull yellow exter-\\nnal layer of the tooth root. The cementum is very thin, \\nespecially next to the cervical line, similar in thickness \\nto a page in this text (only 50–100 mm thick where one \\nmm is one millionth of a meter). It is composed of 65% \\ncalcium hydroxyapatite (mineralized and calcified), \\n35% organic matter (collagen fibers), and 12% water. \\n(Another author, Melfi, states that the mineral  content \\nof cementum is about 50%.) Cementum is about as \\nhard as bone but considerably softer than enamel. \\nIt develops from the dental sac (mesoderm), and is \\nproduced by cells called cementoblasts [se MEN toe \\nblasts].\\nThe cementoenamel [se MEN toe ehn AM el] junc-\\ntion (also called the CEJ) separates the enamel of the \\ncrown from the cementum of the anatomic root. This \\njunction is also known as the cervical [SER vi kal] line, \\ndenoting that it surrounds the neck or cervix [SER \\nviks] of the tooth.\\nDentin [DEN tin] is the hard yellowish tissue under-\\nlying the enamel and cementum, and makes up the \\nmajor bulk of the inner portion of each tooth crown \\nand root. It extends from the pulp cavity in the center \\nof the tooth outward to the inner surface of the enamel \\n(on the crown) or cementum (on the root). Dentin is \\nnot normally visible except on a dental radiograph, \\nor when the enamel or cementum have been worn \\naway, or cut away when preparing a tooth with a bur, \\nor destroyed by decay. Mature dentin is composed of \\nabout 70% calcium hydroxyapatite, 18% organic mat-\\nter (collagen fibers), and 12% water, making it harder \\nthan cementum but softer and less brittle than enamel. \\nDentin develops from the embryonic dental papilla \\n(mesoderm). The cells that form dentin, called odon-\\ntoblasts [o DON toe blasts], are located at the junction \\nbetween pulp and dentin.\\nTERMINOLOGY USED TO DESCRIBE THE PARTS OF A TOOTHSECTION III\\nApical foramen\\nRoot canal\\nCementum\\nDentin\\nCementodentinal \\n        junction\\nPulp chamber\\nCementoenamel junction\\nEnamel\\nDentinoenamel junction\\nLingual surface of crown\\nAnatomic Crown Anatomic Root\\nFIGURE 1-6.

This junction can be best seen on a radio-\\ngraph ( Fig. 1-7 ). The cementodentinal [se MEN toe \\nDEN tin al] (or dentinocemental) junction is the inner \\nsurface of cementum where cementum joins dentin. \\nCementum is so thin that it is difficult to identify this \\njunction on a radiograph.\\nPulp is the soft (not calcified or mineralized) tissue \\nin the cavity or space in the center of the crown and \\nroot called the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity has a coro-\\nnal portion ( pulp chamber) and a root portion ( pulp \\ncanal or root canal ). The pulp cavity is surrounded \\nby dentin, except at a hole (or holes) near the root tip \\n(apex) called an apical [APE i kal] foramen [fo RAY \\nmen] (plural foramina [fo RAM i na]). Nerves and \\nblood vessels enter the pulp through apical foramina. \\nLike dentin, the pulp is normally not visible, except on a \\ndental radiograph (x-ray) or sectioned tooth (Fig. 1-7). \\nIt develops from the dental papilla (mesoderm). Pulp is \\nsoft connective tissue containing a rich supply of blood \\nvessels and nerves. Functions of the dental pulp are as \\nfollows:\\nFormative• : Dentin-producing cells (odontoblasts) \\nproduce dentin throughout the life of a tooth. This is \\ncalled secondary dentin.\\nSensory• : Nerve endings relay the sense of pain caused \\nfrom heat, cold, drilling, sweet foods, decay, trauma, \\nor infection to the brain, so we feel it. However, the \\nnerve fibers in a dental pulp are unable to distin-\\nguish the cause of the pain.\\nNutritive• : Blood vessels transport nutrients from \\nthe bloodstream to cells of the pulp and the odon-\\ntoblasts that produce dentin. (Surprisingly , blood in \\nthe tooth pulp had passed through the heart only \\n6 seconds previously .)\\nDefensive or protective• : Pulp responds to injury \\nor decay by forming reparative dentin  (by the \\n odontoblasts).\\nB. ANATOMIC VERSUS CLINICAL \\nCROWN AND ROOT\\n1. ANATOMIC CROWN AND ROOT \\nDEFINITION\\nThe anatomic crown  is that part of the tooth (in the \\nmouth or handheld) normally covered by an enamel \\nlayer, and the anatomic root is the part of a tooth cov-\\nered by cementum (Fig. 1-6). A cervical line (or cemen-\\ntoenamel junction) separates the anatomic crown from \\nthe anatomic root. This relationship does not change \\nover a patient’s lifetime.\\n2. CLINICAL CROWN AND ROOT (ONLY \\nAPPLIES WHEN THE TOOTH IS IN THE \\nMOUTH AND AT LEAST PARTIALLY \\nERUPTED)\\nThe clinical crown  refers specifically to the amount \\nof tooth visible in the oral cavity , and the clinical root \\nrefers to the amount of tooth that is not visible since it \\nis covered with gingiva (gum tissue). Clinically , the gin-\\ngival margin in a 25-year-old patient with healthy gin-\\ngiva approximately follows the curvature of the cervical \\nline, and under these conditions, the clinical crown is \\nessentially the same as the anatomic crown. However, \\nthe gingival margin is not always at the level of the cer-\\nvical line because of the eruption process early in life or \\ndue to recession of the gingiva later in life. For example, \\nthe gingiva on a partially erupted tooth of a 10-year-old \\ncovers much of the enamel of the anatomic crown of \\nthe tooth, resulting in a clinical crown (exposed in the \\nDentinoenamel junction\\nEnamel\\nDentin\\nPulp\\nPeriodontal ligament\\n(dark line)\\nAlveolar bone\\nFIGURE 1-7. Radiographs (x-rays) showing \\ntooth crowns covered with enamel, and the \\ntooth roots embedded within the alveolar \\nbone. You can distinguish the whiter outer \\nenamel shape from the darker inner dentin, \\nand the darkest pulp chamber in the middle of \\nthe tooth. The very thin, dark periodontal \\nligament can also be seen between the root and \\nthe bone, but the cementum cannot be seen.'),\n",

This results in a clinical \\ncrown that is longer than the anatomic crown since the \\nclinical crown in this mouth consists of the entire ana-\\ntomic crown plus the part of the anatomic root that is \\nexposed (Fig. 1-8). In this situation, the clinical root is \\nshorter than the anatomic root.\\nClinical\\ncrown\\nAnatomic\\ncrown\\nFIGURE 1-8. This maxillary molar has a very long clinical \\ncrown since all of the anatomic crown and much of the anatomic \\nroot are exposed due to recession of the gingiva and loss of bone.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nExamine the mouths of several persons of differ-\\nent ages to see if the cervical line of the anatomic \\ntooth is visible or hidden. As the individual grows \\nolder, the location of the margin of the gingiva \\nmay recede toward the root tip (apically) because \\nof periodontal disease or injury (such as from the \\nfaulty use of oral hygiene aids). Of course, the \\nlocation of the cervical line on the tooth remains \\nthe same. In other words, the distinction between \\nthe anatomic crown and root does not change \\nover a lifetime.\\nINTRODUCTION TO THE PERIODONTIUMSECTION IV\\nThe periodontium [per e o DON she um] is defined \\nas the supporting tissues of the teeth in the mouth, \\nincluding surrounding alveolar bone, the gingiva, the \\nperiodontal ligament, and the outer, cementum layer of \\nthe tooth roots (Fig. 1-9). Alveolar bone is the portion \\nof the upper (maxillary) or lower (mandibular) bones \\nthat surrounds the roots of the teeth. The gingiva is \\nthe part of the soft tissue in the mouth that covers the \\nalveolar bone of the jaws, and is the only part of the \\nperiodontium that is visible in a healthy mouth. Part of \\nit is firmly bound to the underlying alveolar bone and \\nis called attached gingiva. The other part is free gin-\\ngiva (or marginal gingiva) which is a collar of thin gin-\\ngiva that surrounds each tooth and, in health, adapts to \\nthe tooth but provides access into the potential space \\nbetween the free gingiva and the tooth which is called a \\ngingival sulcus (crevice). The gingival margin (or free \\ngingival margin) is the edge of the gingiva closest to the \\nbiting or chewing surfaces of the teeth (Fig. 1-10).\\nThe gingival sulcus is not seen visually but can be \\nevaluated with a periodontal probe, since it is actually \\na space (or potential space) between the tooth  surface \\nand the narrow unattached cervical collar of free gin-\\ngiva. If you insert a thin probe into this sulcus, it \\nshould extend only 1 to 3 mm deep in a healthy per-\\nson. The interdental (interproximal) papilla [pah PILL \\nah] (plural is papillae [pa PILL ee]) is that part of the \\ncollar of free gingiva that extends between the teeth. \\nA healthy papilla conforms to the space between two \\nteeth (interproximal space), so it comes to a point near \\nwhere the adjacent teeth contact. The papilla also has a \\nhidden sulcus where dental floss can fit once it passes \\nbetween the teeth.\\nThe periodontal ligament  is a very thin ligament \\ncomposed of many tissue fibers that attach the outer \\nlayer of the tooth root (covered with cementum) to \\nthe thin layer of dense alveolar bone surrounding each \\ntooth. The groups of fibers of the periodontal ligament \\nrepresented in Figure 1-9 are greatly enlarged. The \\nentire thickness of the ligament would only be about as \\nthick as a page or two in this text.'),\n",

To name a line angle, combine the \\nnames of the two surfaces, but change the “al” ending of \\nthe first surface to an “o.” (A guideline has been sug-\\ngested for the order used when combining terms. Use the \\nfollowing order: mesial is used first, then distal, facial, \\nlingual, and lastly occlusal or incisal.

Point angles are the junctions of three \\ntooth surfaces at a point, such as a mesiobucco-occlusal \\npoint angle. Examples of these external line angles and \\npoint angles are seen in Figure 1-12.\\nTo describe a dimension of a tooth, terms can be com-\\nbined to denote the direction over which a dimension \\nis taken. For example, the length of an incisor crown \\nfrom the incisal edge to the cervical line is called the \\nincisocervical dimension or the dimension incisocervi-\\ncally (Fig. 1-12). Other similar terms used to describe \\na crown dimension include mesiodistal, faciolingual or \\nbuccolingual, and occlusocervical. The length of a root \\ncould be described as its cervicoapical dimension.\\nF. DIVISIONS (THIRDS) OF THE CROWN \\nOR ROOT (FOR PURPOSES OF \\nDESCRIPTION)\\nA tooth can be divided into thirds in order to define \\nmore precisely the location of its specific landmarks \\n(Fig. 1-13). When viewing a tooth from the facial, lin-\\ngual, mesial, or distal surface, horizontal lines can divide \\nthe tooth crown into the following thirds: cervical, mid-\\ndle, and occlusal (or incisal). Similarly, horizontal lines \\ncan divide the root into thirds: cervical, middle, and \\napical (toward the root tip or apex).\\nWhen viewing a tooth from the facial (or lingual) \\nsurface, vertical lines can be used to divide the crown or \\nroot into mesial, middle, and distal thirds. When view-\\ning a tooth from the proximal (mesial or distal) sur-\\nface, vertical lines can be used to divide the crown or \\nroot into facial, middle, and lingual thirds. When view-\\ning a tooth from the occlusal (or incisal) surface, lines \\nrunning mesiodistally can be used to divide the crown \\nDISTAL\\nLINGUA\\nL\\nLAB\\nIAL\\nBUCC\\nAL DISTAL\\nMESIAL\\nMESIAL\\nANTERIOR TOOTH\\nDistolingual\\nline angle\\nDistolabial\\nline angle\\nMesiolabial\\nline angle\\nIncisocervical dimension\\nDistobuccal line angle\\nDistolingual line angle\\nLinguo-occlusal\\nline angle\\nBuccolingual dimension\\nMesiodistal dimension\\nMesiobuccal\\nline angle\\nMesiobuccal-\\nocclusal\\npoint angle\\nPOSTERIOR TOOTH\\nLINGUAL\\nFIGURE 1-12.

ROOT-TO-CROWN RATIO\\nIf we know the length of a tooth root from the cervical \\nline to the tip of the root (or tip of the longest buccal \\nroot of teeth with multiple roots) and the length of the \\ncrown (from the cervical line to the tip of the longest \\ncusp or highest part of the incisal edge), we can calculate \\na root-to-crown ratio. The root-to-crown ratio is the root \\nlength divided by crown length. Since the roots of teeth \\nare normally longer than their crowns, the root-to-crown \\nratios for teeth are normally >1.0. For example, the aver-\\nage root length of a maxillary central incisor is only \\n13.0 mm and the crown length is 11.2 mm; these lengths \\nare not that different compared to other teeth. The root-\\nto-crown ratio is 13 divided by 11.2, which equals 1.16. \\nWhen this number is close to 1, it indicates that the root \\nis not much longer than the crown. Compare this with a \\nmaxillary canine, where the average root is much longer, \\nat 16.5 mm, but the crown is only 10.6 mm, for a much \\nlarger root-to-crown ratio of 1.56. This larger ratio indi-\\ncates that the root is over one and a half times (1.56×) \\nlonger than the crown. The obvious difference between \\nthe root-to-crown ratio on these two teeth is apparent in \\nFigure 1-14. The ratio can be clinically significant, since \\na tooth with a small root-to-crown ratio (closer to 1) \\nis not the best choice for attaching and supporting false \\nteeth, because the additional attached teeth would apply \\neven more force on a tooth that already has a short root \\ncompared to its crown length.\\nDivision of teeth in thirds\\nFacial or labial view\\nApical 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nCervical 3rd\\nCervical 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nIncisal 3rd\\nFacial 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nLingual 3rd\\nMesial 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nDistal 3rd\\nMesial view\\nLingual 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nLabial 3rd\\n(facial)\\nDistal 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nMesial 3rd\\nCervical 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nApical 3rd\\nOcclusal 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nCervical 3rd\\nFacial or buccal view\\nOcclusal views\\nDistal view\\nLingual 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nBuccal 3rd\\n(facial)\\nDistal 3rd\\nMiddle 3rd\\nMesial 3rd\\nFIGURE 1-13.

MORPHOLOGY OF AN \\nANATOMIC CROWN\\nTeeth are made up of many rounded elevations, ridges, \\ndepressions, and grooves. Specific tooth structures that \\noccur with some frequency on teeth within a class have \\nbeen assigned specific names. To identify the following\\nanatomic structures, reference will be made to rep-\\nresentative drawings of various teeth seen in figures \\nthroughout this section.\\n1. ELEVATIONS (ROUNDED) \\nAND RIDGES (LINEAR)\\nA cusp (with a cusp tip or apex) is a pyramidal eleva-\\ntion, or peak, located on the occlusal surfaces of molars \\nand premolars, and on the incisal edges of canines. \\nA cusp is named according to its location on the tooth. \\nFor example, on a two-cusped premolar, the two cusps \\nare named after the surface adjacent to each cusp: buc-\\ncal or lingual. On a four-cusped molar, the four cusps \\nare named after the adjacent line angles: mesiobuccal, \\ndistobuccal, mesiolingual, and distolingual. Refer to \\nFigure 1-15 for examples of cusp names on teeth with \\ntwo, three, and four cusps.\\nEach cusp has four cusp ridges (linear prominences \\nof enamel) converging toward the cusp tip. These \\nfour ridges form the shape of a four-sided, somewhat \\nrounded pyramid. If you drew a line along the great-\\nest linear bulge of each of these four ridges, the lines \\nwould intersect at the cusp tip (indicated by the “X” \\non Fig. 1-16).

The fourth ridge from the \\ncusp tip to the faciolingual middle of the tooth is called \\na triangular ridge.\\nThe mesial and distal cusp ridges  are also known \\nas cusp slopes or cusp arms. When viewed from the \\nfacial or lingual aspect, they are the inclined surfaces \\nor slopes that converge toward the cusp tip to form an \\nangle (seen on the facial cusps of a premolar and molar \\nin Fig. 1-17, and on the lingual cusp of a premolar from \\nthe occlusal view in Fig. 1-19A). For some teeth, the \\nsharpness or bluntness of a cusp angle could be an \\nimportant trait.\\nOn anterior teeth, mesial and distal marginal ridges \\nare located on the mesial and distal border of the lingual \\nsurface and converge toward the cingulum seen on the \\nlingual surface of an incisor in Figure 1-18. On posterior \\nteeth, marginal ridges are located on the mesial and dis-\\ntal borders of the occlusal surface. The mesial marginal \\nridge on a premolar is shaded red in Figure 1-19A.\\nTriangular ridges are located on each major cusp of \\nposterior teeth. Each triangular ridge extends from a \\ncusp tip toward the depression (sulcus) in the middle \\nof the occlusal surface faciolingually (Fig. 1-19A and B). \\nWhen a triangular ridge from a facial cusp joins with a \\ntriangular ridge from an adjacent lingual cusp, the two \\nridges together form a longer ridge called a transverse \\nridge. A transverse ridge  crosses the occlusal surface \\nof posterior teeth in a more or less buccolingual direc-\\ntion, running between the buccal and lingual cusps on \\na premolar (Fig. 1-19) or connecting the buccal and \\nlingual cusps that are lined up across from one another \\non a molar (seen on the two-cusped premolar and on \\na mandibular molar in Fig. 1-20). An oblique ridge is \\nfound only on maxillary molars. It crosses the occlusal \\nsurface obliquely (diagonally) and is made up of one \\nridge on the mesiolingual cusp joining with the trian-\\ngular ridge of the distobuccal cusp (seen in Fig. 1-20 \\non the maxillary molar). According to Ash,\\n1 the ridge \\nof the mesiolingual cusp that forms the lingual half of \\nthe oblique ridge is the distal cusp ridge  of the mesio-\\nlingual cusp.\\nPerhaps the most indistinct ridge emanating from \\nthe cusp tip is the facial (labial or buccal) ridge. The \\nbuccal (cusp) ridge  is a subtle ridge running cervico-\\nocclusally in the middle third of the buccal surface of \\npremolars (Fig. 1-19A). Similar in appearance to a buc-\\ncal ridge on posterior teeth, a canine has a labial ridge \\nthat runs cervicoincisally and can be very prominent on \\nmaxillary canines.\\nWhen viewing posterior teeth from the occlusal view, \\nit is important to distinguish the crown outline of an \\nentire tooth from the occlusal table of that tooth. The \\ncrown outline is the outer outline of the entire tooth \\ncrown from the occlusal view, whereas the occlusal \\ntable is the outline of the smaller occlusal surface that \\nis bounded by adjoining mesial and distal cusp ridges \\nand marginal ridges that surround it (Fig. 1-21).\\nFIGURE 1-16.

On the lin-\\ngual of all anterior teeth, a cingulum [SING gyoo lum] \\nis the enlargement or bulge on the cervical third of the \\nlingual surface of the crown on anterior teeth (incisors \\nand canines) (Figs. 1-18 and 1-23).\\nOn the facial surface of permanent molars (and all \\nprimary teeth), the subtle ridge running mesiodistally \\nin the cervical one third of the facial surface of a crown \\nis called the cervical ridge. It is most pronounced on \\nthe outline of the mesiobuccal cusp of mandibular sec-\\nond molars as seen in Figure 1-24.\\nMamelons are three small tubercles or scallops, \\neach formed from one of the three facial developmen-\\ntal lobes on the incisal edges of newly erupted incisors \\n(Fig. 1-25). (Lobes will be described in more detail in \\nthe last section of this chapter.) Usually mamelons are \\nnot evident on adult dentition since they are worn off \\nafter the tooth comes into functional contact with its \\nopposing teeth. If you have the opportunity, observe \\na 7-year-old smile to see these mamelons on newly \\nerupted incisors. When mamelons remain on an adult, \\nit is because these teeth do not contact opposing teeth in \\nfunction, as may occur when maxillary and  mandibular \\nanterior teeth do not touch together during function \\n(called an anterior open-bite relationship). When a \\npatient desires, the dentist can reduce the mamelons to \\nmake the incisal edge more uniformly curved.\\nFinally , perikymata [pear i KY mah tah] are the numer-\\nous, minute horizontal ridges on the enamel of newly \\nerupted permanent teeth (Fig. 1-26). They form from the \\noverlapping of layers of enamel laid down  during tooth \\nformation. These lines are closer together in the cervical \\nthird of the crown than in the incisal third.

On many \\nmolars and three-cusped premolars, major develop-\\nmental grooves separate adjacent cusps. For example, \\non mandibular molars, a buccal groove runs from the \\ncentral groove onto the buccal surface separating the \\nmesiobuccal from distobuccal cusps, and on maxillary \\nmolars, a lingual groove extends from the central sul-\\ncus onto the lingual surface separating the mesiolingual \\nfrom the distolingual cusps (Fig. 1-28).\\nAdditional grooves that are not developmental \\ngrooves are called supplemental grooves. These small \\nirregular (extra) grooves on the occlusal surface do not \\noccur at the junction of the lobes or major portions of \\nthe tooth (Fig. 1-27).\\nA fissure is a very narrow cleft or crevice at the \\ndepth of any groove, caused by the incomplete fusion \\nof enamel during tooth development (the white arrow \\nin Fig. 1-29 ). Tooth decay (also called dental caries \\n[CARE eez]) often begins in the deepest part of a fis-\\nsure (seen in dentin as the dark area between the two \\nblack arrows in Fig. 1-29) and described in more detail \\nin the Operative Dentistry chapter.\\nA fossa [FAH sah] (plural, fossae [FAH see]) is a small \\nhollow or depression found between the marginal ridges \\non the lingual surfaces of anterior teeth (particularly max-\\nillary incisors, Fig. 1-30), and at specific locations on the \\nocclusal surfaces of posterior teeth (denoted by the circles \\nin Fig. 1-31). Pits often occur at the depth of a fossa where \\ntwo or more grooves join. For example, within the distal \\nfossa on a premolar, there is a distal pit at the junction of \\nthe central groove with the distobuccal and distolingual \\nfossa grooves (Fig. 1-31). Like fissures that are found at \\nthe depth of grooves, pits are enamel defects where den-\\ntal decay may begin. Most two-cusped premolars have \\ntwo fossae (mesial and distal), whereas most molars and \\nthree-cusped premolars have at least three fossae (mesial, \\ncentral, and distal) seen in Figure 1-32.\\nbuccal groove\\ncentral groove buccal groove\\ndistobuccal triangular\\nlingual groove\\nbuccal groove\\nmesiobuccal \\ntriangular\\ngroove\\nmesiolingual \\ntriangular\\ngroove\\ndistal oblique\\ngroove\\nlingual groove\\nMandibular molars\\nMaxillary molars\\nM\\nM\\nM\\nM\\nB\\nB\\nL\\nL\\nD\\nD\\nD\\nD\\ntransverse groove\\nof oblique ridge\\ncentral groove\\nFIGURE 1-28.

Ridges emanating from the mountain peak are \\nlike the cusp ridges and triangular ridges. The depres-\\nsion between the mountains (or cusps) is a valley , like \\nthe tooth occlusal sulcus. The dried river bed at the bot-\\ntom of the valley (sulcus) is like a groove, and if it is \\ncracked open, it is like a fissure. Where river beds con-\\nverge (grooves or fissures converge), the whirlpools and \\neddies may have formed a depression, like a fossa, pos-\\nsibly with a pit at its depth. Needless to say , it is hard to \\ndefine exactly where a mountain stops and the valley \\nstarts, just as it would be hard to define exactly where a \\ntooth cusp stops and a sulcus or fossa begins. Just real-\\nize that these terms are not precise, but that they are \\nhelpful when learning how to reproduce tooth form \\nduring construction of crowns and  placement of fillings, \\nor when learning to finish and polish an  existing filling.\\nB. EXTERNAL MORPHOLOGY \\nOF THE ANATOMIC ROOT\\nRefer to Figure 1-33 while studying the external mor-\\nphology of tooth roots. Recall that the anatomic root \\nis the part of a tooth that is covered with cementum. \\nThe apex of the root is the tip or peak at the end of the \\nroot, often with visible openings called apical foram-\\nina, where the nerves and blood vessels enter into the \\ntooth pulp. The cervix [SUR viks] or neck of the tooth \\nis the slightly constricted region of union of the crown \\nand the root.\\nSome new terms apply to multi-rooted teeth \\n(Fig. 1-33B). The root trunk or trunk base is the part \\nof the root of a multi-rooted molar or two-rooted pre-\\nmolar next to the cementoenamel junction that has \\nnot yet split (like a stubby tree trunk before it gives off \\nbranches). The furcation [fur CAY shun] is the place \\non multi-rooted teeth where the root trunk divides into \\nseparate roots (called a bifurcation on two-rooted teeth \\nand a trifurcation on three-rooted teeth). The furcal \\nregion or interradicular space is the region or space \\nbetween two or more roots, apical to the place where \\nthe roots divide from the root trunk.\\nFIGURE 1-29. A cross section of a mandibular molar shows \\nan occlusal groove (white arrow), which actually has a fissure \\n(crack-like fault) extending through the outer enamel and into \\nthe dentin.

CERVICAL LINE (CEJ) CURVATURE\\nWhen viewed from the mesial or distal aspect, the cervi-\\ncal line of a tooth curves (is convex) toward the incisal \\nor occlusal surface (Fig. 1-33).

RELATIVE SIZE\\nIn order to document the relative sizes of tooth crowns \\nand roots, Dr. Woelfel studied a convenient sample \\nof 4572 extracted teeth. His findings are presented in \\nTables 1-7 at the end of this chapter. This table should \\nnot be memorized, but it can be useful when compar-\\ning the average dimensions of each tooth, and appre-\\nciating the wide range of dimensions for each tooth. \\nA summary of the most important highlights of that \\ndata is presented in T able 1-3.\\nWhen viewed from the occlusal aspect, each den-\\ntal arch is somewhat U-shaped or parabolic like the \\nfamous landmark in Missouri, the St. Louis Arch (recall \\nFig. 1-2). The incisal edges and the buccal cusp tips \\nfollow a curved line around the outer edge of the den-\\ntal arch; the lingual cusp tips of the posterior teeth \\nfollow a curved line nearly parallel to the buccal cusp \\ntips. Between the buccal and lingual cusps is the sulcu-\\nlar groove, which runs anteroposteriorly the length of \\nthe posterior teeth in each quadrant.\\nWhen the arches are viewed from the buccal aspect, \\nan anteroposterior curve  (curve of Spee) is evident \\nwhere the cusp tips of posterior teeth follow a gradual \\ncurve anteroposteriorly (see Fig. 1-34). The curve that \\nconnects the cusp tips in the maxillary arch is convex, \\nwhile the curve in the mandibular arch is concave.\\nMaxillary posterior teeth are tilted with the crowns \\nmore facial, and mandibular posterior teeth are tilted \\nwith the crowns more lingual (Fig. 1-35).

When a line connects the \\nbuccal and  lingual cusps of the same type of molars and \\npremolars on opposite sides of the arch, this side-to-\\nside curve is the mediolateral curve (of Wilson). The \\nmediolateral curve of the maxillary arch is convex, \\nwhereas that of the mandibular arch is concave.\\nA. MID-ROOT AXIS LINE\\nThe mid-root axis line  (or root axis line) is an imagi-\\nnary line through the center of the tooth root. It can be \\nvisualized on the facial or lingual surface as a line that \\ndivides the tooth at the cervix into mesial and distal \\nhalves (Fig. 1-36A). When viewing the mesial or distal \\nsurface, it divides the tooth at the cervix into facial and \\nlingual halves (Figs. 1-36B). It is an important reference \\nline for describing the location of tooth landmarks. For \\nexample, you will learn that the incisal edge of a man-\\ndibular canine is more likely to be lingual to the mid-\\nroot axis line, whereas the incisal ridge of a maxillary \\ncanine is more likely to be labial to the mid-root axis \\nline (as seen in Fig. 1-36B).\\nB. HEIGHT OF CONTOUR (CREST \\nOF CURVATURE) ON A FACIAL \\nOR LINGUAL SURFACE\\nThe shape and extent of the greatest bulge on the facial \\nand lingual crown surfaces help determine the direction \\nthat food particles are deflected in as they are pushed cer-\\nvically over the tooth surfaces during mastication. When \\nwe chew food, these natural tooth convexities divert food \\naway from the thin free gingiva and gingiva sulcus sur-\\nrounding the cervix of the tooth, and toward the firmer \\ntissues of the mouth, thus minimizing trauma to the gin-\\ngiva. If teeth were flat facially and lingually , food could \\nmore likely damage the gingiva (Fig. 1-37). Needless to \\nMandibular arch\\nMaxillary arch\\nFIGURE 1-35.

Refer to T able 1-4 for a summary of the location \\nof the facial and lingual heights of contour for anterior \\nteeth compared to posterior teeth.\\nC. CONTACT AREAS (OR PROXIMAL \\nHEIGHTS OF CONTOUR)\\nWhen the teeth are in normal, ideal alignment within \\nan arch, the location of the mesial or distal height of \\ncontour (when viewed directly from the facial or lin-\\ngual sides) is essentially the same location as contact \\nareas (seen from the facial view in Fig. 1-36A and from \\nthe occlusal view in Fig. 1-38A). Contact areas are the \\ngreatest heights of contour or location of the greatest \\nbulges on the proximal surfaces of tooth crowns, where \\none tooth touches an adjacent tooth. Floss must pass \\nthrough contact areas to clean the proximal surfaces, \\nwhich are otherwise inaccessible to the toothbrush.\\nIn a young person, contact areas on teeth start off \\nbetween recently erupted teeth as contact points. Then, \\nas the teeth rub together in function, these points \\nbecome somewhat flattened and truly become contact \\nareas. (It has been shown by careful measurements \\nthat, by age 40 in a healthy mouth with a complete den-\\ntition, 10 mm of enamel has been worn off the con-\\ntact areas of the teeth in an entire arch. This averages \\n0.38 mm per contact area on each tooth and certainly \\nemphasizes the amount of proximal wear that occurs. \\nTherefore, we would expect contact areas on teeth of \\nolder people to be large and somewhat flattened.)\\nThe proximal contact of each tooth with the adja-\\ncent teeth has important functions:\\nThe positive contact of all teeth within each den-• \\ntal arch stabilizes the position of teeth within each \\narch.\\nContact helps prevent food impaction which can • \\ncontribute to decay and gum and bone disease \\n( periodontal disease).\\nContact protects the interdental papillae of the gin-• \\ngiva by diverting food buccally and lingually.\\nA diastema [di ah STEE mah] is a space that exists \\nbetween two adjacent teeth in the same arch that is not \\nthe result of a missing tooth. It is most commonly seen \\nbetween the maxillary right and left central incisors, \\nbut can occur between any teeth (Fig. 1-39).\\nBefore learning the location of the proximal con-\\ntacts for each type of tooth, it will be helpful to learn \\nthe following general guidelines that apply to most per-\\nmanent teeth. Exceptions to these general rules will be \\npresented in later chapters.\\nWhen viewing teeth from the facial, contact areas • \\nare located in one of three places: in the incisal (or \\nocclusal) third, at the junction of the incisal \\n(or occlusal) and middle thirds, or in the middle \\nthird of the crown. Contact areas are not normally \\nlocated in the cervical third.\\nOn most teeth, the distal contact is more cervical • \\nthan its mesial contact (Fig. 1-36A).\\nMesial contact areas of the central incisors are posi-• \\ntioned most incisally, and contacts are located more \\ncervically (in or near the middle third) on molars.\\nWhen viewing posterior teeth from the occlusal • \\nview, contacts are often located slightly to the facial \\nof the tooth midline buccolingually (Fig. 1-38A).\\nWhen viewing anterior teeth from the incisal view, • \\ncontacts are nearly centered faciolingually.\\nD. EMBRASURE SPACES\\nWhen adjacent teeth contact, the continuous space \\nthat surrounds each contact area can be divided into \\nfour separate triangular embrasure spaces (Fig. 1-40). \\nThese spaces are narrowest closest to the contact area \\nwhere the teeth are in tight contact, and widen facially \\nto form a buccal or labial embrasure, widen lingually to \\nform a lingual embrasure, and widen occlusally (or \\nincisally) to form an occlusal or incisal embrasure. The \\nfourth space, cervical to the contact area and between \\ntwo adjacent teeth, is properly called the interproximal \\nspace.\\nThe interproximal space, when viewed from the \\nfacial or lingual, is a triangular embrasure space \\nbetween adjacent teeth located cervical to their contact \\nareas. The sides of the triangle are formed by the proxi-\\nmal surfaces of adjacent teeth, with the apex of the tri-\\nangle at the contact between two teeth. This space is \\nFIGURE 1-39.

Occlusion [ah \\nKLOO zhun] is the contacting of occlusal or incisal \\nsurfaces of opposing maxillary and mandibular teeth. \\nTo occlude literally means to close, as in closing \\nyour teeth together. The importance of proper occlu-\\nsion cannot be overestimated. It is essential for both \\ndental health and general health, and for a patient’s \\ncomfort and ability to speak, chew , and enjoy food. \\nUnderstanding occlusion requires not only a knowl-\\nedge of the relation of the mandible to the maxillae, \\nbut also of the jaw joints, their complexities, and the \\nmuscles, nerves, ligaments, and soft tissues that affect \\nthe position of the mandible. These topics will be \\ncovered in much more depth later in this book. The \\narrangement of teeth within the dental arches (align-\\nment, proximal contacts, and embrasure spaces) was \\ndiscussed in the previous section of this chapter, and \\nthe ideal relationship of the mandibular dental arch of \\nteeth to the maxillary dental arch of teeth will be pre-\\nsented in this section.\\nIdeal tooth relationships  were described and clas-\\nsified in the early 1900s by Edward H. Angle. He clas-\\nsified ideal occlusion as class I  and defined it based \\non the relationship between the maxillary and man-\\ndibular dental arches. When closed together, the teeth \\nare in their maximum intercuspal position , or best \\nfitting together of the teeth, as shown in Figure 1-41. \\nThis relationship can be achieved on handheld mod-\\nels when the maxillary teeth fit as tightly as possible \\nagainst the mandibular teeth (that is, are most stable). \\nThe  following specific tooth relationships define class I \\nideal occlusion:\\nHorizontal overlap of anterior teeth• : The incisal \\nedges of maxillary anterior teeth overlap the man-\\ndibular teeth such that the incisal edges of maxillary \\nteeth are labial to the incisal edges of mandibular \\nteeth (best seen in Fig. 1-41).\\nVertical overlap of anterior teeth• : The incisal edges \\nof the maxillary anterior teeth extend below (over-\\nlap vertically) the incisal edges of the mandibular \\nteeth so that, when viewed from the facial, the incisal \\nedges of mandibular incisors are hidden from view \\nby the overlapping maxillary incisors (Fig. 1-42).\\nRelationship of posterior teeth• : The maxillary pos-\\nterior teeth are positioned slightly buccal to the man-\\ndibular posterior teeth (Fig. 1-43) so that:\\nThe buccal cusp tips and buccal surfaces of the • \\nmaxillary teeth are buccal to those in the man-\\ndibular arch.\\nThe lingual cusps of maxillary teeth rest in • \\nocclusal fossae of the mandibular teeth.\\nThe buccal cusps of the mandibular teeth rest in • \\nthe occlusal fossae of the maxillary teeth.\\nThe lingual cusp tips and lingual surfaces of the • \\nmandibular teeth are lingual to those in the max-\\nillary arch.\\nRelative alignment• : The vertical (long) axis midline of \\neach maxillary tooth is slightly distal to the vertical axis \\nof its corresponding mandibular tooth type so that:\\nThe tip of the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary • \\nfirst molar is aligned directly over the \\n mesiobuccal \\nAnteroposterior curve\\n(curve of Spee)\\nFIGURE 1-41.

All normal teeth show evidence of \\nhaving developed from three or more lobes. As a gen-\\neral rule, the facial portion of incisors, canines and pre-\\nmolars forms from three lobes, and the cingulum area \\nor lingual cusp(s) each form from one lobe. Therefore, \\nincisors develop from four lobes: three facial lobes \\n(forming three incisally located mamelons) and one \\nlingual lobe forming the cingulum area. Canines, and \\npremolars with one buccal and one lingual cusp, also \\ndevelop from four lobes: three facial lobes forming the \\nfacial portion, and one lingual lobe forming the cingu-\\nlum area on the canine or the one lingual cusp on the \\npremolar. Premolars with one buccal and two  lingual \\ngroove (the mesial of two buccal grooves) on the \\nmandibular first molar ( Fig. 1-44). This relation-\\nship of first molars (the first permanent teeth to \\nerupt) is a key factor in the definition of class \\nI occlusion . Further, the maxillary canine fits \\ninto the facial embrasure between the mandibular \\ncanine and first premolar.\\nMost teeth in an ideal dental arch have the poten-• \\ntial for occluding with two teeth in the opposing \\narch. For example, the distal surface of the maxil-\\nlary first molar in Figure 1-41 is posterior to the \\ndistal surface of the mandibular first molar and \\ntherefore occludes with both the mandibular first \\nand second molar. Exceptions include the man-\\ndibular central incisor which, due to its size and \\nlocation, only occludes with the maxillary central \\nincisor (as seen in Fig. 1-42) and the maxillary \\nthird molar which only occludes with the man-\\ndibular third molar.\\nTo summarize, ideal occlusion involves a class I rela-\\ntionship between the maxillary and mandibular first \\nmolars in maximum intercuspal position. Also, there \\nshould be no large facets and/or bruxing habits, bone \\nloss, crooked teeth, loose teeth, or joint pain.\\n1 Other \\nclasses of occlusion (malocclusion) will be discussed in \\ndetail in Chapter 9.\\n14131211109\\n242526272829\\n23 22 21 20 19\\n8765\\nFIGURE 1-42.

An elephant’s skull is not larger than necessary to house its brain. The size is needed to provide mechani-\\ncal support for the tusks (one third of their length is embedded in the skull) and the enormous molars. Each molar weighs about 9 pounds and is nearly a foot long \\nmesiodistally on the occlusal surface. Tusks (the central incisors) can be as long as 11½ feet and weigh 440 pounds.5\\n‡Guinea pigs have the same formula, except that they have only one maxillary incisor.\\nThe beaver has four strong curved incisors. They have very hard, bright orange enamel on the labial surface and much softer exposed dentin on the lingual \\nsurface. As the dentin wears off, this leaves very sharp cutting edges of enamel. The incisors continue to grow throughout life. The posterior teeth have flat, rough \\nedges on the occlusal surface, and they stop growing at 2 years of age. There is a large diastema immediately posterior to the incisors, and flaps of skin fold inward \\nand meet behind the incisors to seal off the back part of the mouth during gnawing.\\nTherefore, splinters are kept out. The flaps of skin relax for eating and drinking.\\nThe shrew has two hooked cusps on the upper first incisor. Its primary dentition is shed in utero. The shrew’s 1- to 11/2-year life span is limited by the wear on \\ntheir molars. Death occurs by starvation once the molars wear out. Also, their small body can store only enough food for 1 to 2 h, so they must feed almost con-\\ntinually. Their diet consists of small invertebrates, woodlice, and fruit.\\nThe vampire bat has large canines, but its highly specialized upper incisors, which are V-shaped and razor-edged, are what remove a piece of the victim’s skin. \\nThe bat’s saliva contains an anticoagulant, and its tongue rolls up in a tube to suck or lap the exuding blood.\\nSome vertebrates do not have any teeth (complete anodontia) but have descended from ancestors that possessed teeth. Birds have beaks but depend on a \\ngizzard to do the grinding that molars would usually perform. Turtles have heavy jaw coverings, which are thin edged in the incisor region and wide posteriorly for \\ncrushing. The duck-billed platypus has its early-life teeth replaced by keratinous plates, which it uses to crush aquatic insects, crustaceans, and molluscs. The whale-\\nbone whale and anteaters also have no teeth, but their diets do not require chewing.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE 1\\nSketch a tooth and adjacent gingiva in cross sec-\\ntion (similar to Fig. 1-9) and label the following \\nstructures: enamel, dentin, cementum, pulp cav-\\nity, pulp chamber, apical foramen location, den-\\ntinoenamel junction, cementoenamel junction, \\ndentinocemental junction, periodontal ligament \\nspace, alveolar bone, gingiva, gingival sulcus, \\nanatomic crown, and anatomic root.'),\n",

Due to similari-\\nties between the mesial and distal, these surfaces will \\nbe discussed together in this text under the heading of \\nproximal surfaces.\\nC. CLASS TRAITS FOR ALL INCISORS\\nFirst, consider the class traits of incisors, that is, traits \\nthat apply to all incisors.\\nDevelopmental lobes: Recall from Chapter 1 that the \\nfacial surface of all anterior teeth forms from three labial \\nlobes: the mesial, middle, and distal lobes. Incisors usu-\\nally have two shallow vertical developmental depres-\\nsions separating the three lobes that form the facial \\nsurfaces. Subtle shading highlights these depressions \\non the drawings in Figure 2-5. The three lobes also con-\\ntribute to three rounded elevations on the incisal edge \\ncalled mamelons, located on the incisal edges of newly \\nerupted incisor teeth (Fig. 2-2). Finally , remember that \\na fourth (lingual) lobe forms the lingual bulge called a \\ncingulum. See T able 2-1 for a summary of the number \\nof lobes forming each type of incisor.\\n1. GENERAL SIMILARITIES OF MOST INCISORS \\nFROM THE FACIAL VIEW\\nRefer to page 1 of the Appendix while studying the \\nsimilarities of most incisors. Note that there may be \\nexceptions to the general incisor traits presented here, \\nand these are noted in capital letters.\\nAll incisor crowns, when viewed from the facial, have \\na relatively straight or slightly curved incisal edge (vs. \\nall other teeth that have one or more pointed cusp tips). \\nTheir crowns are relatively rectangular, longer incisogin-\\ngivally than wide mesiodistally (Appendix 1a). They taper \\n(narrower) from the widest mesiodistal areas of proxi-\\nmal contact toward the cervical line, and are  therefore \\nnarrowest in the cervical third and broader toward the \\nincisal third (Appendix 1b). Incisor crown outlines are \\nmore convex on the distal than on the mesial surfaces \\nEXCEPT on mandibular central incisors, which are sym-\\nmetrical (Appendix 1c). Incisor mesioincisal angles are \\nmore acute (sharper) than distoincisal angles EXCEPT on \\nthe symmetrical mandibular central incisors, where the \\nangles are not noticeably different (Appendix 1d). Incisor \\ncrown contact areas (greatest height of contour proxi-\\nmally) on mesial surfaces are located in the incisal third. \\nOn the distal surfaces, the contact areas are more cervical \\nthan the mesial EXCEPT on the distal of the mandibular \\ncentral, which is at the same level as the mesial due to its \\nsymmetry (Appendix 1e). Before wear, the incisal edge \\nof all incisors EXCEPT the symmetrical mandibular cen-\\ntral slopes cervically (appears shorter) toward the distal. \\nFinally , the cervical line curves toward the apex in the \\nmiddle of the facial (and lingual) surfaces (Appendix 1l).\\nIncisor roots , when viewed from the facial, taper \\n(become more narrow) from the cervical line to the \\napex (Appendix 1f). They are wider faciolingually \\nthan mesiodistally EXCEPT on maxillary central inci-\\nsors, where the mesiodistal width is approximately the \\nsame as the faciolingual thickness (observe this differ-\\nence in root widths by comparing the facial and mesial \\nroot views in Appendix 1g). Incisor roots may bend in \\nthe apical one third EXCEPT maxillary central incisor \\nroots, which are not as likely to bend; this bend is more \\noften toward the distal (Appendix 1h). All incisor roots \\nare longer than the crowns (Appendix 1i).\\nFIGURE 2-2.  Left and right maxillary central \\nincisors, lingual views. Both teeth are “shovel shaped”\\ndue to their deep lingual fossae along with pro-\\nnounced lingual marginal ridges and cingula. Both \\nteeth have three rounded protuberances on their \\nincisal edge called mamelons (arrows). The right \\ntooth has a stained pit on the incisal border of the \\ncingulum where caries can penetrate without being \\neasily noticed.'),\n",

CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL INCISORS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nIncisor crowns, when viewed from the lingual, have a \\nnarrower lingual surface because the mesial and dis-\\ntal surfaces converge lingually (best appreciated from \\nthe incisal view, Appendix 1j). The mesial and distal \\nmarginal ridges converge toward the lingual cingulum \\n(Appendix 1k).\\n3. CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL INCISORS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nIncisor crowns, when viewed from the proximal, are \\nwedge shaped or triangular (Appendix 1m). They have \\na facial outline that is more convex cervically than \\nincisally , and the facial height of contour (greatest bulge) \\nthat is in the cervical third, just incisal to the cervical \\nline (Appendix 1n). The lingual height of contour is also \\nin the cervical third, on the cingulum, but the contour \\nof the incisal two thirds of the lingual surface is concave \\nfrom cingulum area to the incisal edge. Therefore, the \\nlingual outline is S-shaped, being convex over the cingu-\\nlum and concave from the cingulum nearly to the incisal \\nedge (Appendix 1p). The concave portion of the lingual \\nsurface on the maxillary anterior teeth is a most impor-\\ntant guiding factor in the closing movements of the lower \\njaw because the mandibular incisors fit into this concav-\\nity and against marginal ridges of the maxillary incisors \\nas maximum closure or occlusion is approached.\\nThe cervical line proximally curves toward the incisal \\nedge. The resultant curve is greater on the mesial sur-\\nface than on the distal (compare the mesial and distal \\nviews in Appendix 1o).\\nThe incisor roots, when viewed from the proximal, \\nare widest in the cervical third and gradually taper to a \\nrounded apex (Appendix 1f).\\n4. CHARACTERISTICS OF ALL INCISORS \\nFROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nIncisor crowns, when viewed from the incisal, have a \\nlingual fossa that is concave just incisal to the cingulum.\\nThey have an incisal ridge that terminates mesiodis-\\ntally at the widest portion of the crown (Appendix 1q). \\nThe labial outline is broader and less curved than the \\nconvex lingual outline (Appendix 1r). Marginal ridges \\nconverge toward the cingulum (Appendix 1k), and the \\ncrown outline tapers from proximal contact area toward \\nthe cingulum (Appendix 1j), resulting in a narrower \\nlingual than labial surface.\\nD. ARCH TRAITS THAT DISTINGUISH \\nMAXILLARYMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULARMANDIBULAR\\nINCISORS\\nRefer to page 2 of the Appendix while reading about \\nthese arch traits that can be used to distinguish man-\\ndibular incisors from maxillary incisors.\\nMandibular incisors are generally smaller than max-\\nillary incisors. Mandibular central and lateral incisors \\nlook more alike and are more nearly the same size \\nin the same mouth, compared to greater differences \\nbetween maxillary central and lateral incisors (Fig. 2-3).\\nMandibular incisor crowns are flatter than maxil-\\nlary incisor crowns on the mesial and distal surfaces \\n(Appendix 2q) and have contact areas located closer to \\n10987\\n23242526\\nFIGURE 2-3.

Attrition (wear) on the incisal \\nridges of incisors that occurs when shearing or incising \\nfood results in tooth wear that is in a different location \\non maxillary incisors compared to mandibular incisors \\n(Fig. 2-4). This wear occurs when the labial part of the \\nincisal edges of mandibular incisors slides forward and \\ndownward while contacting the lingual surface and part \\nof the incisal edge of opposing maxillary incisors. The \\nwear results in a shiny , flat, polished surface of enamel on \\nthe incisal edge called a facet [FAS it]. Assuming a normal \\ntooth relationship, facets that commonly form on man-\\ndibular incisors are more on the labial slope of the incisal \\nedge, sloping cervically toward the labial. In contrast, fac-\\nets on maxillary incisors occur more on the lingual slope \\nof the incisal edge, sloping cervically toward the lingual \\nfossa and may occur on the lingual marginal ridges.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nRefer to Table 2-2 for a summary of the noticeable \\narch traits that distinguish maxillary from mandibu-\\nlar incisors and see how many of them can be used \\nto differentiate the rows of maxillary and mandibu-\\nlar incisors from various views in Figures 2-5, 2-6, \\n2-8, 2-10, and 2-13 through 2-15 and 2-17.\\nthe incisal ridge than maxillary incisors (Appendix 2r \\nand 2i).

If possible, repeat this on a model with \\none or more maxillary incisors missing.\\n• Select and separate maxillary incisors from a selec-\\ntion of all teeth on a bench top.\\n• Holding a maxillary incisor, determine whether it is \\na central or a lateral, and right or left. Then assign \\na Universal number to it.\\nWithin this section, maxillary central and lateral inci-\\nsors are compared for similarities and differences. \\nThese traits are presented for each view of the tooth: \\nfacial, lingual, proximal (including mesial and distal), \\nand incisal.\\nA. MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nExamine several extracted maxillary central and \\nlateral incisors and/or tooth models as you read. \\nHold these teeth root up and crown down, as they \\nare positioned in the mouth.

CROWN SHAPE OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nBased on Woelfel’s studies, the crown of the  maxillary \\ncentral incisor  is the longest of all human tooth \\ncrowns (although at least two other authors describe \\nthe mandibular canine crown  as the longest crown \\noverall\\n9,10). The maxillary central also has the widest \\ncrown of all incisors. The crown is usually longer (inci-\\nsogingivally) than wide (mesiodistally) A (Appendix \\n2a). The crown is narrowest in the cervical third and \\nbecomes broader toward the incisal third.\\nThe crown of the maxillary lateral incisor  is con-\\nsiderably narrower mesiodistally than the crown of the \\nmaxillary central incisor, and the root is longer, giving \\nthis entire tooth a longer, slender look\\nB (Appendices 2a \\nand d). The crown outline is less symmetrical than \\non the central incisor. Normally, the labial surface of \\nthe maxillary lateral incisor is more convex or less flat \\nmesiodistally than on the maxillary central. Mamelons, \\nand particularly labial depressions, are less prominent \\nand less common than on the central incisor.\\n2. INCISOPROXIMAL LINE-ANGLES \\nOF THE MAXILLARY INCISOR FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nOn the outline of maxillary central incisors, the angle \\nformed by the mesial and incisal surfaces (called the \\nmesioincisal angle) is nearly a right angle. The distoin-\\ncisal angle is more rounded, and the angle is slightly \\nobtuse or greater than a right angle (Appendix 2b).\\nOn maxillary lateral incisors, both the mesioincisal \\nand distoincisal angles are more rounded than on the \\ncentral incisor (Appendix 2b). The mesioincisal angle \\nis more acute than the distoincisal angle, accentu-\\nated by the incisal edge sloping cervically toward the \\ndistal (more so than on the maxillary central incisor) \\n(Appendix 2c).\\n3. PROXIMAL CONTACT AREAS \\nOF MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe mesial contacts of both a maxillary central and lat-\\neral incisor are in the incisal third, very near the incisal \\nedge for the central and slightly more cervical on the \\nlateral. The distal contacts of both incisors are more \\ncervical than the mesial. For a maxillary central incisor, \\nthe distal contact is near the junction of the incisal and \\nthe middle thirds; for the maxillary lateral incisor it is \\neven more cervical, in the middle third (making this \\ndistal contact the most cervical for any incisor).'),\n",

ROOT-TO-CROWN PROPORTIONS \\nOF MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nOn a maxillary central incisor, the root is only slightly lon-\\nger than the crown resulting in a root-to-crown ratio that \\nis the smallest of any permanent tooth (Appendix 2d). The \\nmaxillarylateral incisor root is longer than on the central.C\\nThis results in a root that appears longer in proportion to \\nthe crown than on the maxillary central incisor.\\n5. ROOT SHAPE OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW (COMPARED \\nWITH THE PROXIMAL VIEW)\\nThe root of the maxillary central incisor is thick in the \\ncervical third and narrows through the middle to a blunt \\napex. Its outline and shape is much like an ice cream \\ncone. An apical bend is not common in the maxillary cen-\\ntral incisor. The central incisor root is the only maxillary \\ntooth that is as thick at the cervix mesiodistally as facio-\\nlingually . Compare the root width seen on the proximal \\nview to the root width seen on the labial view in Appendix \\n2n. All other types of maxillary teeth have roots that are \\nthicker faciolingually than mesiodistally .\\nD Because of its \\nshortness and conical shape, the maxillary central incisor \\nroot may be a poor choice to support a replacement tooth \\nas part of a dental bridge (i.e., a replacement tooth crown \\nattached to, and supported by , two adjacent teeth).\\nThe root of a maxillary lateral incisor tapers evenly \\ntoward the rounded apex, and the apical end is com-\\nmonly bent distally (seen in 12 of the 14 maxillary \\nlateral incisors in Fig. 2-5, lower row).\\nB. MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 2-6 while studying the lingual traits of \\nmaxillary incisors.\\n1. LINGUAL FOSSAE OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nLarge lingual fossae are located immediately incisal to \\nthe cingulum and bounded by two marginal ridges. The \\nfossae of both maxillary incisors are most often deeper \\nthan fossae in mandibular incisors. The lingual fossa of \\nthe maxillary lateral incisor, although smaller in area, is \\noften even more pronounced than on the central incisor. \\nNote the deeper lingual fossae on many maxillary lateral \\nincisors compared to central incisors in Figure 2-6.\\n2. CINGULUM OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe cingulum on the maxillary central incisor is usu-\\nally well developed and is located off-center, distal to \\nthe root axis line that bisects the root longitudinally. \\n(This can also be seen from the incisal view.) The cin-\\ngulum on the maxillary lateral incisor is narrower than \\non the central, and it is almost centered on the root axis \\nline (Appendix 2e).\\n3. MARGINAL RIDGES OF MAXILLARY \\nINCISORS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe mesial and distal marginal ridges vary in promi-\\nnence on all maxillary incisors from one person to \\nanother. They may be prominent or  inconspicuous.\\nMaxillary incisors with a deep lingual fossa and \\nprominent mesial and distal marginal ridges are called \\n“shovel-shaped incisors”\\nE (as seen in Fig. 2-2). 2–6 They \\nmay also have been worn smooth (forming facets) from \\nattrition or chewing by the mandibular incisors.\\nOn the both types of maxillary incisors, mesial mar-\\nginal ridges (from the incisal edge to the cingulum) are \\nlonger than distal marginal ridges because of the taper \\nof the incisal edge from mesial to distal (Appendix 2f). \\nThis is also accentuated on the maxillary central incisor \\nbecause its cingulum is off center toward the  distal. Also \\nthe shorter distal marginal ridges are more curved com-\\npared to the mesial marginal ridges that are straighter \\nincisocervically (seen in most incisors in Fig. 2-6).\\n4. PITS AND ACCESSORY RIDGES \\nOF MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nOn both types of maxillary incisors, but more frequently in \\nlateral incisors, a lingual pit may be detectable at the incisal \\nborder of the cingulum where the mesial and distal mar-\\nginal ridges converge. This pit may need to be restored or \\nsealed in order to prevent or arrest decay . (Notice the deep \\nlingual pits in several maxillary lateral incisors in Fig. 2-6.)\\nSmall, narrow accessory lingual ridges may extend ver-\\ntically from the cingulum toward the center of the fossa \\nin both types of maxillary incisors (fewer in maxillary \\nlaterals). Accessory ridges may be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in num-\\nber (tooth No. 9 in Fig. 2-7 shows these accessory ridges \\nmost clearly). Tiny grooves separate these ridges.\\nF, G\\nFIGURE 2-7.  The lingual surfaces of these maxillary incisors \\nreveal accessory ridges, especially on tooth No. 9 (at the arrow).'),\n",

This \\ndifference is most pronounced on anterior teeth. The \\nmesial curvature of the cervical line of the maxillary \\ncentral incisor is larger than for any other tooth, extend-\\ning incisally one fourth of the crown length, whereas \\nthe distal cervical line curves less. The curvature of the \\nmesial cervical line of the maxillary lateral incisor  is \\nalso considerable but slightly less than on the central.\\nH\\n3. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR \\nOF MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nOn the labial outline, the height of contour on both \\ntypes of maxillary incisors is in the cervical third, just \\nincisal to the cervical line. The labial outline becomes \\nnearly flat in the middle and incisal thirds. The lingual\\noutline is “S” shaped, and the height of contour is also \\nin the cervical third, on the cingulum.\\n4. ROOT SHAPE AND ROOT DEPRESSIONS \\nOF MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM THE \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe root of the maxillary central incisor is wide facio-\\nlingually at the cervix and tapers to a rounded apex. \\nThe lingual outline is nearly straight in the cervical \\nthird, and then curves labially toward the tip in the \\nmiddle and apical thirds. The labial outline is even \\nstraighter. In contrast, the root of the maxillary lateral \\nincisor tapers more evenly throughout the root toward \\nthe blunt apex. From the proximal view , this flatter \\nfacial root outline and more convex lingual root outline \\nis evident in many central incisors in Figure 2-8.\\nThe distal root surfaces of both types of maxillary \\nincisors are likely to be convex, without a longitudinal \\ndepression, but the mesial root surfaces could have a \\nslight depression in the middle third cervicoapically, \\nslightly lingual to the center faciolingually. A slight \\nmesial root depression is discernible in the shaded line \\ndrawings in Figure 2-8.\\nD. MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE INCISAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 2-10 when studying the incisal view . To \\nfollow this description, a maxillary incisor should be held \\nin such a position that the incisal edge is toward you, the \\nlabial surface is at the top, and you are looking exactly \\nalong the root axis line. You should see slightly more \\nlingual surface than labial surface if the incisal ridge is \\n5. ROOT SHAPE OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe root contour of all maxillary incisors, like all ante-\\nrior teeth, is convex and tapers, becoming narrower \\ntoward the lingual surface (Fig. 2-6).\\nC. MAXILLARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nRefer to Figure 2-8 while studying the proximal traits of \\nmaxillary incisors.\\n1. INCISAL EDGE OF MAXILLARY INCISORS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nOn both maxillary incisors, the incisal edge is com-\\nmonly just labial to the root axis line or may be on the \\nroot axis line (Appendix 2o). From the mesial side, the \\nslight distolingual twist of the incisal ridge of the maxil-\\nlary central incisor places the distal portion at the ridge \\neven somewhat more lingual than on the mesial (barely \\nvisible in Fig. 2-8).\\n2.

As \\nwas seen from the lingual view , the cingulum of the \\nmaxillary central incisor is slightly off-center to the \\ndistal, resulting in the mesial marginal ridge measuring \\nlonger than the distal marginal ridge (seen best from \\nthe lingual view in Appendix 2f).\\nThe crown of the lateral incisor  resembles the cen-\\ntral incisor from this aspect, but its outline is more \\nround or oval  than triangular since the labial outline \\nis noticeably more convex than on the central inci-\\nsor. The cingulum of the lateral incisor is nearly cen-\\ntered mesiodistally . Compare the triangular shape of \\nthe maxillary central incisor to the more round or \\nslightly oval shape of the maxillary lateral incisor in \\nFigure 2-11 . These differences in outline shapes are \\nevident when comparing the more triangular central \\nincisors with the more oval or round lateral incisors \\nin Figure 2-10.\\n3. INCISAL RIDGE CONTOUR OF MAXILLARY \\nINCISORS FROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe incisal ridge or edge of the maxillary central inci-\\nsor is 1.5 to 2 mm thick faciolingually and is slightly \\ncurved from mesial to distal, the convexity being on the \\nlabial side. It terminates mesially and distally at the wid-\\nest portion of the crown (Appendix 1q). The position of \\nthe distoincisal angle is slightly more lingual than the \\nposition of the mesioincisal angle, which then gives the \\nincisal edge its slight distolingual twist as though some-\\none took the distal half of the incisal edge and twisted \\nit to the lingual (Appendix 2g). The incisal ridges on \\nlateral incisors are straighter mesiodistally than on the \\ncentral incisors.\\nBe aware that for maxillary central incisors, the two \\ntraits just discussed (the cingulum displaced to the dis-\\ntal and the distolingual twist of the incisal edge) are \\ndependent on how the tooth is held. When viewed from \\nthe incisal, the distolingual twist of the incisal edge is \\nmore obvious when the cingulum is aligned vertically \\n(Appendix 2g), whereas the displacement of the cin-\\ngulum to the distal is more obvious when the incisal \\nedge is aligned horizontally (Appendix 2e). This is why \\nthese two traits are shown on page 2 of the Appendix, \\nshowing two views of the same tooth, each having a \\nslightly different alignment to accentuate the trait being \\ndiscussed.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nIn determining a right from a left central incisor \\nwhen it is not in the mouth (e.g., on the bracket \\ntable with other incisors after multiple extrac-\\ntions), you need to distinguish the mesial from the \\ndistal surface. If you look at the facial surface of a \\ntooth with its root aligned correctly for the correct \\narch and are able to identify the mesial or distal \\nsurface, you can place the tooth in its correct \\nquadrant (right or left) and assign its Universal \\nnumber. Evaluate the photographs of maxillary \\nincisors in the figures in this chapter and, using \\nthe chart in each figure, see how many “mesial \\nversus distal” traits can be used to differentiate \\nthe mesial from the distal surfaces and therefore \\nright from left incisors. For example, in Figure \\n2-5 look at the labial surfaces for the shape of \\nthe incisal angles (more rounded on distal) and \\nthe position of the contact areas (more cervical \\non distal), or look at Figure 2-8 for the amount \\nof cervical line curvature on the mesial and distal \\nsides (more curved on mesial), as well as the flat-\\nter or concave mesial versus convex distal root \\nsurfaces. From the lingual view, look at Figure 2-6 \\nfor the length of the marginal ridges (mesial is lon-\\nger, especially noticeable on maxillary lateral inci-\\nsors), and from the incisal view on the maxillary \\ncentral (Fig. 2-10), look for the distal location of \\nthe cingulum on many maxillary central incisors.\\nINCISAL VIEWS\\nRight maxillary\\nlateral incisor\\nRight maxillary\\ncentral incisor\\nFIGURE 2-11.

If possible, repeat this on a model with \\none or more mandibular incisors missing.\\n• Select and separate mandibular incisors from a \\nselection of all teeth on a bench top.\\n• Holding a mandibular incisor, determine whether it \\nis a central or a lateral and right or left. Then assign \\na Universal number to it (which may not be pos-\\nsible for the symmetrical mandibular central incisor \\nwhich you could identify as No. 24 or 25).\\nA. MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nExamine several extracted teeth and/or models as \\nyou read. Also, refer to page 2 of the Appendix and \\nFigure 2-13 while you study the labial surface of mandib-\\nular incisors. Hold mandibular teeth with the root down \\nand crown up, the position of the teeth in the mouth.\\n1. CROWN SHAPE OF MANDIBULAR INCISORS \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nMamelons are usually present on newly emerged man-\\ndibular incisors and reflect the formation of the facial \\nsurface by three labial lobes ( Fig. 2-12 ). Ordinarily, \\nthey are soon worn off by functional contacts against \\nthe maxillary incisors (attrition).\\nAll mandibular incisor crowns are quite narrow rela-\\ntive to their crown length, but the mandibular central \\nincisor crown is the narrowest crown in the mouth and \\nis considerably narrower than the maxillary central \\nincisor.\\nJ Unlike maxillary incisor crowns in the same \\nmouth where the central is larger than the lateral, the \\nmandibular lateral incisor crown is a little larger in all \\ndimensions than the mandibular central incisor in the \\nsame mouth, as seen when comparing many central and \\nlateral incisors in Figure 2-13. Further, the mandibular \\ncentral incisor is so symmetrical that it is difficult to \\ntell lefts from rights unless on full arch models or in the \\nmouth. About the only notable difference to be found \\nis the greater mesial than distal curvature of the cervi-\\ncal line (normally visible only on extracted teeth). This \\ntrait would not be helpful in identifying one remaining \\ncentral incisor after an orthodontist has realigned the \\nteeth and closed the spaces on either side. The fairly \\nstraight mesial and distal crown outlines taper, becom-\\ning narrower toward the convex cervical line.\\nThe crown of the mandibular lateral incisor resem-\\nbles that of the mandibular central incisor, but it is \\nslightly wider and is not as bilaterally symmetrical. Its \\ncrown tilts distally on the root, giving the impression \\nthat the tooth has been bent at the cervix (Appendix 2l). \\nThis makes the curved distal outline of the crown (from \\nproximal contact area to cervical line) shorter than the \\nstraighter mesial crown outline. Look at the incisors \\nin Figure 2-13 and notice the lack of symmetry of the \\nFIGURE 2-12.  These mandibular incisors have remnants of \\nthree mamelons that reflect the formation of the labial surface \\nof incisors from three labial lobes (plus one lingual lobe forming \\nthe cingulum). These mamelons are partially worn away due to \\nthese teeth biting against maxillary incisors during function.'),\n",

Also, notice that the maxil-\\nlary central incisors are wider and larger than the \\nmaxillary lateral incisors and wider than both of the \\nmandibular incisors, but that the mandibular cen-\\ntral incisors appear narrower and smaller than the \\nadjacent mandibular lateral incisors.\\n2. INCISAL PROXIMAL ANGLES OF MANDIBULAR \\nINCISORS FROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe crown of the mandibular central incisor  is \\nnearly bilaterally symmetrical, so the mesioincisal and \\ndistoincisal angles are very similar, forming nearly right \\nangles (Appendix 2j). The distoincisal angle may barely \\nbe more rounded than the mesioincisal angle. The dis-\\ntoincisal angle of the mandibular lateral incisor, how-\\never, is noticeably more rounded than the mesioincisal \\nangle (Appendix 2j). This helps to distinguish rights \\nfrom lefts prior to attrition (wear).\\n3.

The \\nmesial and distal contact areas of the lateral incisor are \\nnot at the same level (Appendix 2i). Although both the \\nmesial and distal contacts are in the incisal third fairly \\nclose to the incisal edge, the distal contact is notice-\\nably cervical to the level of the mesial contact on lat-\\neral incisors.

With the length \\nof the incisal edge sloping shorter toward the distal on the \\nmandibular lateral incisors, and the cingulum located to \\nthe distal, the mesial marginal ridge on these teeth appears \\nslightly longer than the distal marginal ridge.\\n3. ROOT SHAPE OF MANDIBULAR INCISORS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nAs with other incisor roots, the roots of both types of \\nmandibular incisors are mostly convex and slightly \\nnarrower on the lingual side than on the labial side. \\nYou may see evidence of mesial and distal longitudinal \\nroot depressions from these views.\\nC. MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nRefer to Figure 2-15 while studying the proximal sur-\\nfaces of mandibular incisors.\\n1. INCISAL EDGE ON MANDIBULAR \\nINCISORS FROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe incisal edges of both types of mandibular incisors \\nare normally located on or lingual to the mid-root axis \\n(Appendix 2o). From the mesial side, the distolingual\\ntwist of the incisal ridge of the mandibular lateral inci-\\nsor places the distal portion at the ridge even somewhat \\nmore lingual than on the mesial ( Fig. 2-16), unlike the \\nmandibular central that has no twist. Recall that the \\nmaxillary central incisor also exhibits a slight distolin-\\ngual twist of the incisal edge.\\n2. CERVICAL LINE ON MANDIBULAR \\nINCISORS FROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe cervical line on the mesial of both types of man-\\ndibular incisors normally has a relatively large curva-\\nture that extends incisally over one fourth of the short \\ncrown length. As on other anterior teeth, the curvature \\non the distal is less.\\nM\\n3. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR \\nOF MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nAs on the labial outline of maxillary incisors, the labial \\nheights of contour on both types of mandibular incisors \\nare in the cervical third, just incisal to the  cervical line. \\nThe labial outline becomes nearly flat in the incisal third. \\nThe lingual outlines are “S” shaped, and the heights of \\ncontour are also in the cervical third, on the cingula.\\n4. ROOT SHAPE AND DEPRESSIONS \\nOF MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe relatively large faciolingual dimension of the roots \\nat the cervix on both types of mandibular incisors is \\nvery apparent from the proximal view . The facial and \\nlingual outlines of the roots of all mandibular incisors \\nare nearly straight from the cervical line to the middle \\nthird; then the root tapers with its apex on the axis line \\n(seen in most roots in Fig. 2-15). The cervical portion \\nof the roots on mandibular incisors is considerably \\nwider faciolingually than mesiodistally .\\nN\\nThere is usually a slight longitudinal depression on \\nthe middle third of the mesial and distal root surfaces \\nof both types of mandibular incisors. The distal depres-\\nsions are somewhat more distinct. See T able 2-4 for a \\nsummary of incisor root depressions.\\nD. MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE INCISAL VIEW\\nTo follow this description, the tooth should be held \\nin such a position that the incisal edge is toward \\nthe observer, the labial surface is at the top, and the \\nobserver is looking exactly along the root axis line as in \\nFigure 2-17. You will see slightly more of the labial than \\nthe lingual surface if the incisal ridge is just lingual to \\nthe root axis line.\\n1. CROWN PROPORTIONS \\nOF MANDIBULAR INCISORS FROM \\nTHE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe crowns of both types of mandibular incisor are \\nslightly wider labiolingually than mesiodistally .O This is \\ndifferent from the measurements of the maxillary inci-\\nsors, especially maxillary central incisors, which are \\nconsiderably wider mesiodistally than faciolingually .\\n2. CROWN OUTLINE OF MANDIBULAR \\nINCISORS FROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe mandibular central incisor is practically bilaterally \\nsymmetrical with little to differentiate the mesial half \\nfrom the distal half. The labial height of contour is cen-\\ntered, and the lingual height of contour is centered on \\nthe smooth, narrow cingulum. The mandibular lateral \\nincisor is not bilaterally symmetrical. If you align the \\nincisal edge of the lateral incisor exactly horizontal, the \\ncingulum of the mandibular lateral incisor is located \\ndistal to the mesiodistal midline (Appendix 2k and'),\n",

White and black people are reported to have \\nless frequent occurrences of this characteristic.\\nA study of the skulls of American Indians who lived \\nin Arizona about 1100 AD has disclosed the occurrence \\nof incisor teeth that have a mesial marginal ridge on \\nthe labial surface and a depression, or concavity , on the \\nmesial part of the labial surface just distal to this ridge.\\n10\\nIn these teeth, the distal part of the labial surface is \\nrounded in an unusual manner.

In some Mongoloid \\npeople, the cingulum of mandibular incisors is char-\\nacteristically marked by a short deep groove running \\ncervicoincisally . This groove is often a site of dental \\ncaries.\\nLater, in the chapter on anomalies, you will read \\nabout more variations: palatal gingival grooves, peg \\nshaped incisors, fused mandibular incisors, congeni-\\ntally missing central incisors, and even a lateral incisor \\nemerged distally to the canine.\\nFIGURE 2-18.

How might you \\ngo about it? Try the following steps:\\nFrom a selection of all permanent teeth •\\n(extracted teeth or tooth models), select only \\nthe incisors (based on class traits).\\nDetermine whether each incisor is maxillary or •\\nmandibular using arch traits. Review Table 2-2 if \\nneeded. You should never rely on only one char-\\nacteristic difference between teeth to name them; \\nrather, make a list of many traits that apply to \\na maxillary incisor, as opposed to only one trait \\nthat makes you think it belongs in the maxilla. \\nThis way you can play detective and become an \\nexpert at recognition at the same time.\\nOnce you determine that the tooth is  maxillary, •\\nposition the root up; if it is mandibular, \\n position the root down.\\nUse appropriate traits in order to identify the •\\nfacial surface. This will permit you to view \\nthe tooth as though you were looking into a \\npatient’s mouth.\\nNext, using type traits, determine the type of •\\nincisor you are holding (central or lateral). \\nRefer to the tables and teeth in the figures \\nthroughout this chapter as needed.\\nNext, determine which surface is the mesial. •\\nRefer to figures throughout this chapter as \\nneeded. While viewing the incisor from the \\nfacial and picturing it within the appropriate \\narch (upper or lower), the mesial surface can \\nbe positioned toward the midline in only one \\nquadrant, the right or left.\\nOnce you have determined the quadrant, •\\nassign the appropriate Universal number for \\nthe  incisor in that quadrant.

As such, they often continue to function as a \\nsolid support for the replacement teeth for many years.\\nB. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OR \\nCLASS TRAITS (SIMILARITIES) OF \\nCANINES (BOTH MAXILLARY \\nAND MANDIBULAR)\\nUsing the maxillary right canine as a representative \\nexample for all canines, refer to Appendix page 2 while \\nstudying the traits of all canines.\\n1. SIZE OF CANINES\\nOn average, canines are the longest teeth in each arch, \\nand the maxillary canine  is the longest tooth in the \\nmouth even though the mandibular canine crown is \\nlonger than the maxillary canine crown. (Authors Ash \\nand Kraus state that the mandibular canine crown is the \\nlongest crown in the mouth,\\n1,2 but Dr. Woelfel’s study \\nfound that the maxillary incisor crown is longest.)\\nCanines have particularly long roots A and thick roots \\n(faciolingually) that help to anchor them securely in \\nthe alveolar process. Table 3-4 at the end of this chapter\\nprovides all canine dimensions.\\n2. INCISAL RIDGES AND CUSP TIPS \\nOF CANINES\\nThe incisal ridges of a canine, rather than being nearly \\nstraight horizontally like on incisors, are divided into \\ntwo inclines called the mesial and distal cusp ridges \\n(also called cusp slopes or cusp arms). Subsequently, \\ncanine crowns from the facial view resemble a five-\\nsided pentagon (Appendix 3a). The mesial cusp ridge \\nis shorter than the distal cusp ridge (Appendix 3b). \\nIn older individuals, the lengths of the cusp ridges are \\noften altered by wear (attrition). Canine teeth do not \\nordinarily have mamelons but may have a notch on \\neither cusp ridge, as seen clearly in Figure 3-2.\\nIncisors\\nCanineCanine\\nIncisors\\nCanineCanine\\nPremolars\\nPremolarsPremolars\\nPremolars\\nMolarsMolars\\nMolars Molars\\n2nd   Molars\\n1st   Molars\\n1st   Premolars\\nCanines\\nLateral incisors\\n2nd   Premolars\\nCentral incisors\\nPosteriorteeth\\nPosteriorteeth\\nAnterior teeth\\nMAXILLARY\\nAnterior teeth\\nMANDIBULAR\\n3rd   Molars\\n3rd   Molars\\n2nd   Molars\\n1st   Molars\\n2nd   Premolars\\n1st   Premolars\\nCanines\\nLateral\\nincisors\\nCentral incisors\\nPERMANENT TEETH\\nPosteriorteeth\\nPosteriorteeth\\nRIGHT LEFT\\n6 11\\n27 22\\nFIGURE 3-1.

LABIAL CONTOUR OF CANINES\\nThe labial surface of a canine is prominently convex with \\na vertical labial ridge (Appendix 3c and Figure 3-2). \\nCanines are the only teeth with a labial ridge, although \\npremolars have a similar-looking ridge called a buccal \\nridge.\\n4. CROWN PROPORTIONS OF CANINES\\nThe measurement of a maxillary or mandibular canine \\ncrown is greater labiolingually than it is mesiodistally\\nB\\n(Appendix 3d). Recall that this proportion (greater labi-\\nolingually than mesiodistally) also applied to both types \\nof mandibular incisors. The root cervix measurements \\nare even more oblong faciolingually.\\nB (Compare the root \\nwidths on the facial and mesial views in Appendix 3i.)\\n5. CANINE TRAITS THAT ARE SIMILAR \\nTO INCISOR TRAITS\\nSimilar to most incisors (EXCEPT the mandibular cen-\\ntral, where contacts are at the same level), the distal \\ncontact area is more cervical in position than the mesial \\ncontact area (Appendix 3g), and the crown outline is \\nmore convex on the distal than on the mesial surface \\n(Appendix 3f). From the proximal views, canine crowns \\nare wedge, or triangular, shaped (Appendix 3o). The \\nheight of contour on the facial surface is in the cervical \\nthird and on the lingual surface is also in the cervical \\nthird on the cingulum (Appendix 3p). The remaining \\noutline of the lingual surface (lingual ridge) is slightly \\nconcave in the middle third and is straight or slightly \\nconvex in the incisal third. Combined, the entire \\nFIGURE 3-2.  Labial view of a maxillary right canine with a \\nprominent labial ridge and notches on mesial and distal cusp ridges\\nFIGURE 3-3.  Maxillary canine (incisal view) showing a \\n characteristic pattern of incisal wear that is diamond shaped.\\nlingual outline is S shaped, as on all other anterior teeth \\n(Appendix 3q).\\nFurther similarities with incisors include the follow-\\ning: crowns taper, narrowing from the contact areas \\ntoward the cervix (Appendix 3e); cervical lines curve \\nmore on the mesial than on the distal surface (com-\\npare mesial and distal views in Appendix 3n); and mar-\\nginal ridges (as well as crowns) taper lingually from the \\ncontact areas toward the cingulum (Appendix 3l), so \\nthe crown is narrower on the lingual half than on the \\nfacial half. From the incisal view, facial outlines are less \\nconvex than lingual outlines (Appendix 3s), and the \\nincisal edges extend from mesial to distal contact areas \\n(Appendix 3r). Further, roots taper narrower from the \\nfacial toward the lingual and taper narrower from \\nthe cervix toward the apex (Appendix 3h). The root tip \\nor apex often bends toward the distal (Appendix 3j). \\nRoots are also longer than crowns\\nC (Appendix 3k).\\nThe location of incisal edge tooth wear on canines \\nis similar to wear on incisors. Facets on the mandibu-\\nlar canine cusp tip and cusp ridge normally form more \\non the labial border, not the lingual border of the cusp \\nridge as occurs on the maxillary canine. If you find wear \\nfacets on the lingual surface of a mandibular canine or \\non the labial surface of a maxillary canine, it is proba-\\nbly because the teeth were not aligned with the normal \\noverlapping of anterior teeth described in Chapter 1. \\nIf needed, refer back to Figure 2-4 for an illustration of \\nthis concept on incisors. In addition, maxillary canines \\nviewed incisally often have a characteristic diamond-\\nshaped wear pattern as seen in Figure 3-3 which does \\nnot occur on other anterior teeth.'),\n",

Therefore, \\ntype traits do not apply to canines, but arch traits \\nare useful to distinguish maxillary from mandibular \\ncanines.\\nA. CANINES FROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nExamine several extracted canines and/or models as \\nyou study this section. As you examine them, hold \\nmaxillary canines with crowns down and mandibular \\ncanines with crowns up. This is the way they are ori-\\nented in the mouth.\\n1. CANINE MORPHOLOGY FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nAlong with the tooth models and the Appendix pages \\n3 and 4 available, refer to Figure 3-4 for viewing simi-\\nlarities and the range of differences of canines from the \\nlabial view .\\nThe facial side of any canine crown is formed from \\nthree labial lobes like the incisors. (The cingulum on \\nthe lingual side of the crown forms from the fourth \\nlobe.) The middle lobe on the facial forms the labial \\nridge (Appendix 3c), which can be quite prominent on \\nthe maxillary canine. The labial ridge runs cervicoin-\\ncisally near the center of the crown in the middle and \\nincisal thirds. Shallow depressions lie mesial and distal \\nto the labial ridge. See T able 3-1 for a summary of the \\nnumber of lobes that form canines.\\nThe labial surface of a mandibular canine  is more \\nsmooth and convex. A labial ridge is often present but \\nnot as pronounced as on the maxillary canines. In the \\nincisal third, the labial crown surface is convex but \\nslightly flattened mesial to the labial ridge and even a \\nlittle more flattened distal to the ridge. (Feel it.)\\n2. CANINE SHAPE AND SIZE FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe mesial outline  of the maxillary canine  crown is \\nbroadly convex in the middle third, becoming nearly \\nflat in the cervical third (Appendix 4b). The outline of \\nthe distal portion of this crown forms a shallow S shape, \\nbeing convex in the middle third (over the height of \\ncontour or proximal contact area) and slightly concave \\nin the cervical third.\\nThe mandibular canine  crown appears longer and \\nnarrower than the crown of the maxillary canine\\nD\\nTRAITS TO DISTINGUISH MAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR CANINE: LABIAL VIEW\\nMAXILLARY CANINE MANDIBULAR CANINE\\nCrown wider mesiodistally\\nCusp angle sharper, more acute\\nMesial cusp ridge shorter than distal\\nMesial, distal proximal contacts more cervical\\nMesial of crown bulges beyond root outline\\nMore pronounced labial ridge\\nMore pointed root tip\\nCrown narrower mesiodistally\\nCusp angle more blunt\\nMesial cusp ridge much shorter than distal\\nMesial cusp ridge almost horizontal\\nMesial, distal proximal contacts more incisal\\nMesial crown outline almost continuous with root with little \\nor no bulge\\nLess pronounced labial ridge\\nMore blunt root tip\\nTRAITS TO DIFFERENTIATE MAXILLARY RIGHT FROM LEFT CANINE LABIAL VIEW\\nMAXILLARY CANINE MANDIBULAR CANINE\\nCrown outline more convex on distal Crown outline more convex on distal, mesial crown outline \\naligns with root\\nMesial cusp ridge almost horizontal\\nDistal crown outline is more convex than mesial crown outline.\\nDistal contact is more cervical than mesial contact.\\nMesial cusp ridge is shorter than distal.\\nFIGURE 3-4.

NO. OF LOBES\\nMaxillary canine Yes 3 + 1 = 4\\nMandibular canine Yes 3 + 1 = 4\\nRule: Number of lobes = 3 facial lobes + 1 lingual lobe per cingulum.\\n(Appendix 4a). The mesial outline of the mandibular \\ncrown is almost flat to slightly convex, nearly in line \\nwith the mesial side of the root, and may not bulge \\nor project beyond the mesial root outline (Appendix \\n4b). This conspicuous feature is quite evident in most \\nmandibular canines in Figure 3-4 but is not seen on \\nmaxillary canines. The distal side of the crown may \\nbe slightly concave in the cervical third; it is convex \\nin the incisal two thirds. There is noticeably more of \\nthe crown distal to the root axis line than mesial to it. \\nThis often makes the lower canine crown appear to be \\ntilted or bent distally when the root is held in a vertical \\nposition ( similar to the mandibular lateral incisor just \\nmesial to it).\\n3. CANINE CUSP TIP AND INCISAL RIDGES \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nRecall that the mesial cusp ridges are normally shorter \\nthan the distal ridges for all canines. The cusp and \\ncusp ridges of the maxillary canine  make up nearly \\none third of the cervicoincisal length of the crown, \\nbecause the angle formed by the cusp ridges is relatively \\nsharp, slightly more than a right angle (105degrees) \\n(Appendix 4c). Compare this to the cusp tip of the man-\\ndibular canine , where cusp ridges form a less sharp, \\nmore obtuse (blunt) angle (120degrees) (Appendix 4c). \\nThe mesial cusp ridge of the mandibular canine is also \\nalmost horizontal compared to its  longer distal cusp \\nridge, which slopes more steeply in an apical  direction. \\nShorter, more horizontal mesial cusp ridges are seen \\nclearly on most mandibular canines in Figure 3-4. Wear \\non the incisal edge may alter the length of the cusp \\nslopes, sometimes even completely obliterating the \\ncusp, resulting in an appearance from the facial that is \\nsimilar to an incisor.\\n4. CANINE PROXIMAL CONTACT AREAS \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe mesial contact area of the maxillary canine  is \\nlocated at the junction of the incisal and middle thirds. \\nThe distal contact area of the maxillary canine, like \\nall anterior teeth, is in a more cervical location on the \\ndistal side than on the mesial side. It is located in the \\nmiddle third, just cervical to the junction of the incisal \\nand middle thirds (recall Appendix 3g). This is the only \\ncanine proximal contact area (mesial or distal) located \\nin the middle third, and it is the most cervical contact \\nof all anterior teeth.\\nThe mesial contact area of the mandibular canine is \\nin a more incisal position than on the maxillary canine \\ndue to its nearly horizontal mesial cusp ridge. It is in \\nthe incisal third just cervical to the mesioincisal angle. \\nThe distal contact area is, as expected, more cervi-\\ncal than the mesial, at the junction of the middle and \\nincisal thirds. See T able 3-2 for a summary of the loca-\\ntion of contact areas on canines.\\n5. CANINE TOOTH PROPORTIONS \\nFROM THE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe maxillary canine  crown is nearly as long as the \\nmaxillary central incisor crown, but the root of the \\ncanine is much longer\\nE making the maxillary canine, on \\naverage, the longest tooth in the mouth (Appendix 3k). \\nThe mandibular canine is considerably larger than \\neither of the mandibular incisors, particularly in length \\nand mesiodistal width.\\nF It is, on average, the longest \\nmandibular tooth.\\n6. CANINE ROOT CONTOUR FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\nThe labial surface of a canine root is normally convex. \\nThe root of the maxillary canine is long, slender, and \\nconical. The apical third is narrow mesiodistally , and the \\napex may be pointed or sharp. The apical third of the \\nroot often bends distally (Appendix 3j).\\nG Most maxillary \\ncanine roots in Figure 5-4 are seen bending distally .\\nThe mandibular canine  root tapers apically to a \\nsomewhat more blunt apex. The apical end of the root \\nis more often straight rather than curving toward the \\nmesial or distal surfaces.\\nH Therefore, on mandibular'),\n",

CANINES FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 3-5  while studying similarities and \\ndifferences of canines from the lingual view.\\n1. CANINE LINGUAL RIDGES AND FOSSAE \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe maxillary canine  has a prominent lingual ridge \\nrunning cervicoincisally from the cusp to the cingulum \\n(Appendix 4d). Mesial and distal lingual fossae lie on \\neither side of the lingual ridge and are usually shallow. \\nSometimes the lingual surface of the maxillary canine is \\nnaturally smooth or worn smooth from attrition so that \\nthe lingual ridge and the two fossae on either side of it \\nare not easily discernible.\\nWith normal occlusion, the lingual surface of the \\nmandibular canine is not subject to lingual wear as on \\nthe maxillary canine, but even without wear, the lin-\\ngual ridge and fossae are normally less prominent.\\n2. CANINE CINGULUM FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe maxillary canine  cingulum is large. Its incisal \\nborder is sometimes pointed in the center, resembling \\na small cusp or tubercle (seen in the far left  maxillary\\ncanine in Fig. 3-5). The cingulum and the tip of the \\ncusp are usually centered mesiodistally (seen best \\nfrom the incisal view in Appendix 4e). The cingulum \\nof the mandibular canine  is low , less bulky , and less \\nprominent than on maxillary canines. Unlike maxil-\\nlary canines, the cingulum lies just distal to the root \\naxis line. This is most apparent from the incisal view in \\nAppendix 4e. (Recall that the distal-to-midline location \\nof the cingulum is also apparent on maxillary central \\nincisors and mandibular lateral incisors.)\\n3. CANINE MARGINAL RIDGES FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe elevated mesial and distal marginal ridges of the \\nmaxillary canines  are usually of moderate size. The \\nlingual ridge is often most prominent, followed by \\nthe distal marginal ridge, and then the least prominent \\nmesial marginal ridge (prior to attrition).\\nJ The mesial \\nmarginal ridge (extending from the proximal contact \\narea to the  cingulum) is longer than the distal marginal \\nridge because of the more incisally located mesial con-\\ntact area.\\nThe marginal ridges and lingual ridge of  mandibular\\ncanines are not prominent, and much of the  lingual\\nsurface appears smooth when compared to that of \\nthe maxillary canines (an arch trait). The somewhat \\ninconspicuous mesial marginal ridge may be longer \\nand straighter than the shorter, more elevated, and \\ncurved distal marginal ridge. The  indistinct lingual \\nridge is seldom the most prominent ridge.\\nK'),\n",

CANINE ROOTS FROM THE LINGUAL \\nVIEW\\nMaxillary and mandibular canine roots are  usually con-\\nvex on the lingual surface and are narrower  mesiodistally\\non the lingual half than on the labial half. Therefore, it \\nis often possible to see both mesial and distal sides of \\nthe root and one or both of the proximal longitudinal \\nroot depressions from this view .\\nC. CANINES FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nRefer to Figure 3-6 while studying the similarities and \\ndifferences of canines from the mesial or distal views.\\n1. CANINE OUTLINE FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe wedge-shaped or triangular-shaped maxillary \\ncanine crown from this view has a bulky (thick) cusp \\nbecause of the prominent labial and lingual ridges. \\nThe mandibular canine  crown is also wedge shaped \\nbut thinner in the incisal portion than the crown of \\nthe maxillary canine because of a less bulky lingual \\nridge. Observe this difference in cusp thickness in most \\ncanines in Figure 3-6.\\n2. INCISAL RIDGE AND CUSP TIP OF CANINES \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe incisal ridge and cusp tip of a maxillary canine\\nare usually located labial to the mid-root axis line. The \\nincisal ridge and cusp tip of the mandibular canine are \\nmost often located slightly lingual to the root axis line, \\nbut it may be centered over it (Appendix 4h). This is \\na good distinguishing trait between mandibular and \\nmaxillary canines. Observe this difference in cusp tip \\nlocation (more labial on maxillary canines and more \\nlingual on mandibular canines) in a majority of canines \\nin Figure 3-6. Further, the distoincisal angle of the \\nmandibular canine is slightly more lingual in position \\nthan the cusp tip because of the distolingual twist of the \\ncrown so that more of the lingual surface is visible from \\nthe mesial aspect, similar to the adjacent mandibular \\nlateral incisors (best appreciated from the incisal view \\non Appendix 4f).\\n3. CANINE HEIGHT OF CONTOUR FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nAs with all teeth, the facial height of contour of the \\nmaxillary canine is in the cervical third of the crown, \\nbut it may not be as close to the cervical line as the \\ncorresponding curvature on the incisor teeth or on the \\nmandibular canine. The labial surface is much more \\nconvex than on the incisors. (Feel it and compare the \\ncurvatures of the incisors and the canines.)\\nThe height of contour of the facial surface of the \\nmandibular canine crown is closer to the cervical line \\nthan on a maxillary canine. There is an almost continu-\\nous crown–root outline on mandibular canines with \\nminimal facial or lingual (cingulum) crown bulge when \\nviewed from the proximal aspects ( Fig. 3-7). This lack \\nof discernible cervical crown bulge beyond the root \\nfacially and lingually is clearly evident in many man-\\ndibular canines in Figure 3-6. This feature can be help-\\nful when distinguishing mandibular from maxillary \\ncanines.\\nAs with all anterior teeth, the lingual heights of \\ncontour of all canines are usually in the cervical third, \\non the cingulum.\\n4. CANINE CERVICAL LINE FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe cervical lines of all canines from the proximal \\nviews usually curve incisally quite a bit (over 2 mm on \\nmaxillary canines). As on incisors, the curvature for \\nall canines is greater on the mesial surface than on the \\ndistal surface, but the difference is less on canines than \\non incisors.\\nL,M\\nThe cervical line on mandibular canines appears to \\ncurve more incisally than on maxillary canines. The fact \\nthat the mandibular canine crowns are narrower facio-\\nlingually than maxillary canines, and have a greater \\nmesial cervical line curve, accentuates the apparent \\ngreater depth of the curve. However, the amount of cur-\\nvature of the cervical lines of the mandibular canines \\nvaries considerably.\\n5. CANINE ROOT SHAPE AND DEPRESSIONS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe labial outlines of the roots of maxillary and mandib-\\nular canines are often slightly convex with the lingual \\noutline more convex, although this varies. Both\\nmaxillary and mandibular canine roots most often have \\nvertical longitudinal (cervicoapical) depressions on \\nthe mesial and distal surfaces, and the distal depres-\\nsions are usually more distinct (deeper), especially on \\nthe lowers.\\nN A summary of the location and relative \\ndepth of root depressions on canines is presented in \\nT able 3-3.'),\n",

CANINES FROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 3-8 for a comparison of similarities and \\ndifferences of canines from the incisal view . To follow this \\ndescription, the tooth should be held so that the incisal \\nedge (cusp tip) is toward the observer, the labial surface \\nis at the top, and the observer is looking exactly down \\nthe mid-root axis line. You should see more of the lingual \\nsurface of the maxillary canine since the cusp tip and the \\ncusp ridges are usually labial to the mid-root axis line, \\nand you should see more of the labial surface of mandib-\\nular canines where the cusp ridges are lingual to the mid-\\nroot axis line, as seen on most canines in Figure 3-8.\\n1. CANINE CROWN PROPORTIONS \\nFROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe maxillary canine crown outline is not  symmetrical.\\nThe faciolingual dimension of the maxillary canine \\ncrown is slightly greater than the mesiodistal dimension\\n(recall Appendix 3d). This is similar to the mandibu-\\nlar anterior teeth but uncharacteristic of the maxil-\\nlary incisors, which are usually wider mesiodistally \\nthan faciolingually. The labiolingual dimension of \\nthe mandibular canine crown is also greater than the \\nmesiodistal measurement even more noticeably than \\non maxillary canines.\\nO This characteristic oblong facio-\\nlingual outline is seen on many mandibular canines in \\nFigure 3-8.\\n2. CANINE INCISAL EDGE (CUSP TIP) \\nCONTOUR FROM THE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe incisal edge (made up of the cusp tip and thick \\nmesial and distal cusp ridges) of the maxillary canine\\nis located slightly labial to the labiolingual center of \\nthe root, and this edge is aligned almost horizontally \\n(Appendix 4f).\\nThe cusp tip of the mandibular canine is near the \\ncenter labiolingually , or it may be lingual to the center. \\nWhen the tooth is held with the faciolingual axis of the \\ncervix of the root exactly vertical, the distal cusp ridge \\nis directed slightly lingually from the cusp tip, placing \\nthe distoincisal angle in a position somewhat lingual to \\nthe position of the cusp tip (Appendix 4f). This lingual \\nplacement of the distoincisal angle gives the incisal part \\nof the crown a slight distolingual twist (similar to the \\nadjacent mandibular lateral incisor and to the maxillary \\ncentral incisor). From this view , the distolingual twist \\nof the crown appears to “bend” to follow the curvature \\nof the dental arch.\\nTable 3-3 PRESENCE AND RELATIVE DEPTH OF LONGITUDINAL ROOT DEPRESSIONS\\nMESIAL ROOT DEPRESSION?

For example, \\nalthough it is rare to find a mandibular canine tooth \\nwith the root divided, this division is known to occur. \\nThe division results in labial and lingual roots and may \\nbe split only in the apical third, or it may extend into \\nthe cervical third of the root (Fig. 3-9).\\nObserve the enormous variation in size and shape \\namong several maxillary and mandibular canines in \\nFigure 3-10.\\nP\\nA maxillary canine with an unusual notch on its \\nmesial cusp slope is seen in Figure 3-11. An unusual \\ncanine with a shovel-shaped lingual surface is evident \\nin Figure 3-12. Other anomalies will be described in \\nChapter 11.\\nPerhaps the most unique canines of all occur on the \\nmale Babirusa (type of wild boar) seen in Figure 3-13.\\nIts two enormous maxillary canines curve backward, \\npiercing the bony snout on each side. Then, they curve \\nin a large arc upward, backward, and finally down \\ntoward the forehead. These unusual maxillary canines \\nserve only to protect the boar’s eyes and upper face. \\nThe Babirusa’s mandibular canines are also very large \\nand tusk-like, and curve up and back, possibly serving \\nto protect the side of his face and for fighting or pierc-\\ning food when his jaw is opened wide.\\nit has been “pinched in” on the facial surface (Appendix \\n4g). This observation is most helpful and is a reliable \\nguide in determining right from left maxillary canines \\nand is seen on many upper canines in Figure 3-8.\\nThe outline of the mandibular canine crown is more \\nsymmetrical than that of a maxillary canine crown. \\nHowever, the labial crown outline mesial to the center-\\nline is noticeably more convex, whereas the labial  outline \\ndistal to the center is more flat.\\n5. CANINE LINGUAL CONTOUR FROM \\nTHE INCISAL VIEW\\nThe lingual ridge of the maxillary canine  divides the \\nlingual surface in half with a shallow fossa on each side. \\nThis ridge and fossae are less evident on the  mandibular\\ncanine.\\nDetermine whether the canine is maxillary or •\\nmandibular. You should never rely on only one \\ncharacteristic difference between teeth to name \\nthem; rather, make a list of many arch traits\\nthat suggest the tooth is a maxillary canine as \\nopposed to only one trait that makes you think \\nit belongs in the mandible. Refer to the arch \\ntraits in Figures 3-4 through 3-8 as needed.\\nIf you determine that the tooth is maxillary, •\\nposition the root up; if it is mandibular, \\nposition the root down.\\nWith the tooth aligned correctly, use •\\n characteristic traits for each surface to identify \\nthe facial surface. This will permit you to view \\nthe tooth as though you were looking into a \\npatient’s mouth.\\nFinally, determine which surface is the mesial. •\\n(Refer to the right/left traits in Figs. 3-4 \\nthrough 3-8 as needed.) While viewing the \\ntooth from the facial and picturing it within the \\nappropriate arch (upper or lower), the mesial \\nsurface can be positioned toward the midline in \\nonly one quadrant, the right or left.\\nOnce you have determined the quadrant, assign •\\nthe appropriate Universal number for the canine \\nin that quadrant. For example, the canine in the \\nupper right quadrant is tooth No. 6.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nAssign a Universal number to a handheld tooth:\\nA patient just had all of his permanent teeth \\nextracted.

The \\nlingual ridge was found to be the most elevated of \\nthe three lingual ridges 46% of the time, the dis-\\ntal ridge was most elevated 36% of the time, and \\nthe mesial marginal ridge was most elevated only \\n18% of the time.\\nK. Of 244 mandibular canines on dental stone casts \\ninspected by dental hygiene students, the distal \\nmarginal ridge was the most prominent of the \\nthree lingual ridges on 63% of the teeth and the \\nmesial marginal ridge was the most prominent on \\nonly 18%. The lingual ridge was most prominent \\nonly on 19% of these unworn lingual surfaces.\\nL. Of the 321 maxillary canines measured by \\nDr. Woelfel’s dental hygiene students, the mesial \\nCEJ ( cementoenamel junction) curvature aver-\\naged 2.1 mm, with a range from 0.3 to 4.0 mm; \\nthe distal CEJ curvature averaged 1.4 mm, with \\na range of 0.2 to 3.5 mm. Such wide variability is \\nnot unusual.\\nM. Based on 637 canines, mandibular canine crowns \\naverage 0.4 mm narrower faciolingually than max-\\nillary canine crowns. Cervical line curves on man-\\ndibular canines varied from 0.2 mm (almost flat) \\nto 4.8 mm. Based on 316 mandibular canines, the \\nmesial curvature averaged 2.4 mm while the dis-\\ntal curve averaged only 1.6 mm making the curve \\n0.8 mm less on the distal surface.\\nN. Based on 100 maxillary canines examined by \\nDr. Woelfel, 70% had a longitudinal depression \\non the mesial root surface (six fairly deep), 23% \\nwere flat, and only 8% had convex mesial middle \\nthird root surfaces with no depression. On the \\ndistal, 90% had a longitudinal depression on \\nthe distal surface (20% were rather deep), and \\nonly 10% had no distal root depression. On 100 \\nmandibular canines examined, 88% had a longi-\\ntudinal mesial root depression (28% were fairly \\ndeep), 8% were flat, and 4% were considered to \\nbe convex. On the distal, 97% had a longitudinal \\ndepression on the distal surface (40% were fairly \\ndeep), and only 3% had flat distal root surfaces. \\nNone of the distal root surfaces was judged to be \\nconvex on the middle third of the root.\\nO. Based on 316 teeth, the crown of the maxillary \\ncanine averages 0.5 mm longer faciolingually than \\nmesiodistally, and the crown of the mandibular \\ncanine averages 0.9 mm wider faciolingually than \\nmesiodistally.\\nP. Referring to the measurements of 637 canines \\nin Table 3-4 under the range column, maxillary \\ncanine crowns from shortest to longest varied by \\n5.4 mm, root length differed by 17.7 mm, and \\noverall length differed by 18.4 mm. In the 1962 \\nissue of the Journal of the North Carolina Dental \\nSociety (46:10), there was a report of an extrac-\\ntion, without incident, of a maxillary left canine \\n47 mm long. On mandibular canines, crown \\nlength, root length, and overall length ranges var-\\nied by 9.6, 12.7, and 18.4 mm, respectively. Can \\nyou imagine one mandibular canine with a crown \\n9.6 mm longer than another one? The shortest \\nmandibular canine (cusp tip to root apex) was \\nonly 16.1 mm long. Two of the mandibular canine \\ncrowns in Figure 3-10 are that long. See if you can \\nspot these teeth.'),\n",

The prominent buccal ridge on the maxillary \\nfirst premolar is similar to the pronounced labial ridge \\non the maxillary canine. Also, the lingual surfaces of \\nmost premolars (like anterior teeth) develop from one \\nlingual lobe. In premolars, this lobe forms one lingual \\ncusp; in anterior teeth, it forms the cingulum (recall \\nFig. 1-45). An EXCEPTION occurs in a common varia-\\ntion of the mandibular second premolar, the three-cusp \\ntype, which develops from three facial and two (not \\none) lingual lobes, forming two lingual cusps. Due \\nto this variation of the mandibular second premolar \\nwith three cusps, the term bicuspid (referring to two \\ncusps) is hardly appropriate for this group of teeth. See \\nT able 4-1 for a summary of the number of lobes forming \\neach type of premolar.\\nCrowns Taper Toward the Cervical : From the \\nfacial, crowns are narrower in the cervical third than \\nocclusally (Appendix 5m). This is because the widest \\nproximal heights (crests) of contour (or contact areas) \\nare located in the occlusal to middle thirds on posterior \\nteeth (similar to the location on anterior teeth in the \\nincisal to middle thirds).\\nCervical Lines : Similar to all anterior teeth, cervi-\\ncal lines, when viewed from the proximal, curve toward \\nthe biting surfaces (occlusal or incisal) (Appendix 5o), \\nand the amount of curvature is slightly greater on the \\nmesial than on the distal surface. When viewed from \\nthe facial or lingual, cervical lines are curved toward \\nthe apex (Appendix 5n).\\nRoot Shape: Like on anterior teeth, premolar roots \\nhave convex facial and lingual root surfaces, and taper \\napically (Appendix 5q). Also, the root tapers toward \\nthe lingual, resulting in a narrower lingual side of the \\nroot mesiodistally. The apical third is most often bent \\ndistally (Appendix 5p). Notice the similarities in root \\nand crown taper and cervical line curvature on incisors, \\ncanines, and premolars when the incisal/occlusal third \\nhas been removed in Figure 4-2.\\n2. CLASS TRAITS THAT DIFFER \\nFROM ANTERIOR TEETH\\nTooth Surface Terminology: Compared to the anterior \\nteeth, the facial surfaces of the posterior teeth are called buc-\\ncal (resting against the cheeks) instead of labial, and pos-\\nterior teeth have occlusal surfaces instead of incisal ridges. \\nThese occlusal surfaces have cusps, ridges, and grooves.\\nOcclusal Cusps Versus Incisal Edges : Unlike ante-\\nrior teeth with incisal edges or ridges and a cingulum, \\npremolars have one buccal (or facial) cusp, and most \\nhave one lingual cusp (Appendix 5b). The EXCEPTION \\nis the mandibular second premolar, which over half of \\nthe time has two lingual cusps.\\nA\\nMarginal Ridges: The marginal ridges of most premo-\\nlars are oriented in a horizontal plane versus a more lin-\\ngually sloping plane in the anterior teeth (Appendix 5c). \\nHowever, an EXCEPTION is the mesial marginal ridge \\nof the mandibular first premolar that is aligned almost \\nhalfway between horizontal and vertical (Appendix 6s).\\nCrown and Root Length : Premolar crowns in both \\narches are shorter than crowns of anterior teeth,\\nB and \\nTable 4-1 GUIDELINE FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF LOBES FOR PREMOLARSa\\nTOOTH NAME NO.

(Just think of the gradation in size as a \\ntransition from the longer incisor and canine crowns \\nto the even shorter molar crowns.) However, the roots\\nof second premolars are slightly longer than first \\npremolars.\\nRoots on maxillary premolars are considerably \\nshorter than on maxillary canines, but similar in length \\nto maxillary incisor roots. Roots on mandibular premo-\\nlars are also shorter than on mandibular canines, but \\nlonger than on mandibular incisors.\\nC Complete data \\ncan be found in Tables 4-6A and 4-6B.\\nHeight (Crest) of Contour : From both mesial and \\ndistal aspects, the facial heights of contour of pre-\\nmolar crowns are in the cervical third, like on ante-\\nrior teeth. However, the heights of contour are more \\nocclusal in position than the corresponding heights of \\ncontour on the anterior teeth (Appendix 5d). In other \\nwords, the greatest facial bulge is farther from the cer-\\nvical line on premolars. An EXCEPTION is the buc-\\ncal height of contour of the mandibular first premolar, \\nwhich may be located as far cervically as on anterior \\nteeth. The location of the lingual height of contour \\nfor premolars is also farther from the cervix relative \\nto anterior teeth. Lingually , it is located in the middle \\nthird occlusocervically compared to the cervical third \\non anterior teeth.\\nContact Areas: The proximal contact areas are gen-\\nerally more cervically located and broader than on \\nanterior teeth.\\n3. OTHER CLASS TRAITS CHARACTERISTIC \\nOF MOST PREMOLARS\\nEvaluate the similarities of all premolars while compar-\\ning models or extracted specimens of all four types of \\npremolars from the views indicated. Also, use the study \\npages from the Appendix page 5 to identify the class \\ntraits. It is important to note that although general \\ncharacteristics are described in this book, there is con-\\nsiderable variation from these descriptions in nature.\\n1–3\\nRemember when studying the maxillary premolars to \\nhold them with their crowns down and roots up. For \\nmandibular premolars, have the crowns up and the \\nroots down. In this manner, the teeth will be oriented \\nas they were in the mouth.\\na. Class Traits of Most Premolars \\nfrom the Buccal View\\nCrown Outline Shape of Premolars : The crown from \\nthe buccal view is broadest at the level of the contact \\nareas and narrower at the cervix: shaped roughly like a \\nfive-sided pentagon, similar to the canine crown shape \\n(Appendix 5g). The mesial and distal outlines of the \\ncrown are nearly straight or slightly convex from con-\\ntact areas to the cervical line.\\nLocation of Most Premolar Contact Areas : Both \\nmesial and distal sides of the crown are convex around \\nthe contact areas, similar to canines. Mesial proximal \\ncontacts are near the junction of the occlusal and \\nmiddle thirds, and the distal contacts are normally \\nslightly more cervical, in the middle third (Appendix \\n5e), EXCEPT on mandibular first premolars, where \\nmesial contacts are usually more cervical than the \\ndistal contacts.\\nRelative Size of Most Premolar Cusp Ridges: As on \\ncanines, when viewed from the facial, the tip of the \\nfacial cusp of a premolar is often slightly mesial to \\nthe vertical root axis line of the tooth (Appendix 5h), \\nwith the mesial cusp ridge of the buccal cusp shorter \\nthan the distal ridge (Appendix 5i). The EXCEPTION \\nto this general rule is the maxillary first premolar, \\nwhere the facial cusp tip is located slightly to the distal \\nof the root axis line and the mesial cusp ridge is longer \\n(Appendix 6e).\\nb. Crown Shape (Outline) of Most Premolars \\nfrom the Lingual View\\nThe crown is narrower on the lingual side than on the \\nbuccal side, EXCEPT some three-cusped mandibular \\nsecond premolars (with two lingual cusps) that may \\nbe wider on the lingual half. The lingual surface is \\nconvex.\\nc. Marginal Ridges of Most Premolars \\nfrom the Proximal Views\\nThe relative height of the mesial and distal marginal \\nridge is similar to the relative height of the proxi-\\nmal contact areas. The mesial marginal ridge is more \\nocclusally positioned than the distal marginal ridge, so \\nif you first look at the mesial side and compare it to \\nthe distal side of this tooth, you should be able to see \\nless of the occlusal surface and triangular ridges from \\nthe distal view (compare mesial and distal surfaces in \\nAppendix 5j). An EXCEPTION is the mandibular first \\npremolar, where the distal marginal ridge is in a more \\nocclusal position than the mesial marginal ridge.\\nd. Class Traits of Most Premolars \\nfrom the Occlusal View\\nTooth Proportions: Like the majority of anterior teeth \\n(except maxillary central and lateral incisors), all types \\nof premolars, on average, are wider faciolingually than \\nmesiodistally\\nD (Appendix 5k).'),\n",

On premolars with only two \\ncusps, the two triangular ridges (one buccal and one \\nlingual) join together to form a transverse ridge, which \\ncan be best observed from the occlusal aspect. An \\nEXCEPTION: The three triangular ridges on the three-\\ncusped mandibular second premolar do not meet so do\\nnot form a transverse ridge (Fig. 4-3B).\\nGrooves and Fossae : A groove (or grooves) runs \\nmesiodistally across the occlusal surface on most pre-\\nmolars. (EXCEPTION: the mandibular first premolar \\nhas a pronounced transverse ridge, often without a \\ngroove running mesiodistally across it.) This groove \\n(or grooves), when present, ends mesially in the \\nmesial fossa and distally in the distal fossa.

This lingual tilting of the crown is charac-\\nteristic of all mandibular posterior teeth  and enables \\ntheir buccal cusps to fit and function both beneath \\nand lingual to the maxillary buccal cusps. Maxillary \\npremolar crowns  are aligned more directly over their \\nroots. This difference is easy to recognize when com-\\nparing the proximal views of maxillary and mandibu-\\nlar premolars in Appendix 6j for maxillary , and 6a for \\nmandibular.\\nCusp Size and Location : The buccal cusp is lon-\\nger than the lingual cusp (or cusps) on all premolars \\n(especially on mandibular firsts), but the difference \\nis minimal on maxillary second premolars (compare \\nAppendix 6c, maxillary , and 6p, mandibular). Most \\npremolar lingual cusp tips are positioned off center to \\nthe mesial EXCEPT on mandibular first premolars and \\nsome mandibular second premolars where they may \\nbe centered (seen from lingual views in Appendixes 6i \\nand 6q).\\nMaxillary right second premolar Mandibular right second premolar (three-cusp type)\\nTriangular ridge\\nTriangular ridge\\nTriangular ridge\\nTriangular ridge\\nMesiolingual cusp\\nBuccal cusp\\nTriangular ridge\\nDistolingual cusp\\nCentral groove\\nMesial\\nmarginal\\nridge\\nMesial\\nfossa\\nTransverse ridge\\nAB\\nFIGURE 4-3.

Compare tooth models \\nand/or extracted maxillary premolars as you read the \\nfollowing characteristics, holding the crowns down and \\nroots up, just as they are oriented in the mouth.\\n1. RELATIVE SIZE OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLAR CROWNS FROM \\nTHE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThe crown of the maxillary first premolar is larger \\nthan the maxillary second premolar, but the root is \\nshorter overall.\\nE The junction of cusp slopes and \\nproximal surfaces ( shoulders) appear more broad, \\nbulging, and angular on the first premolar (especially \\non the mesial) than on the more gently convex second \\npremolar.\\nThe mesial and distal sides of the crown, from the \\ncontact areas to the cervical line, converge more notice-\\nably on the maxillary first premolar than second pre-\\nmolar so the cervical portion of the crown of the second \\npremolar appears relatively wider. Observe the more \\nprominent mesial shoulders and increased crown taper \\non many maxillary first premolars in Figure 4-5.\\n2. LOCATION OF PROXIMAL CONTACTS \\nON MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE BUCCAL VIEW\\nFor both types of maxillary premolars, mesial contacts \\nare usually in the middle third, near the junction of the \\nocclusal and middle thirds. Distal contacts are slightly \\nmore cervical, as on anterior teeth, but still in the mid-\\ndle third (recall Appendix 5e).\\n3. LOCATION OF THE BUCCAL CUSP TIP \\nON MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE BUCCAL VIEW\\nMaxillary second premolars , like canines, have the \\nmesial cusp ridge shorter than the distal cusp ridge. \\nMaxillary first premolars  are UNIQUE in that they \\nhave the only facial cusp on a premolar (or canine) \\nwhere the mesial cusp ridge is longer than the distal \\ncusp ridge. This results in a cusp tip that is distal to the \\nvertical mid-root axis (Appendix 6e and most maxillary \\nfirst premolars in Fig. 4-5).\\n4. SHAPE OF THE BUCCAL CUSP \\nOF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThe buccal cusp of the maxillary first premolar  is \\nrelatively long and pointed or sharp (Appendix 6f), \\nresembling a maxillary canine, with the mesial and dis-\\ntal slopes meeting at almost a right angle (100–110°), \\ncompared to the second premolar, which is less pointed \\nand more obtuse (125–130°), as seen on most second \\npremolars in Figure 4-5.\\n5.

RELATIVE CUSP SIZE OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe lingual cusp is shorter than the buccal cusp, con-\\nsiderably more so on the maxillary first premolar .\\nThe buccal and lingual cusps of the maxillary second \\npremolar are nearly the same length.\\nJ This trait is seen \\nin almost all first premolars in Figure 4-6 and is evi-\\ndent on the lingual views of maxillary premolars on \\nAppendix page 6. The crown is a little narrower on the \\nlingual surface than on the buccal surface, more so on \\nthe first premolar than on the second premolar.\\n2. CUSP RIDGES OF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe mesial and distal ridges of the lingual cusp of the \\nmaxillary first premolar meet at the cusp tip at a some-\\nwhat rounded angle, but the angle is still sharp or steep \\ncompared to molar cusps. The tip of the lingual cusp of \\nthe second premolar is relatively sharper.\\n3. LINGUAL CUSP POSITION FOR MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe tips of the unworn lingual cusps of both types of \\nmaxillary premolars are consistently positioned to the \\nmesial of the mid-root axis line (Appendix 6i). This trait \\nis an excellent way to tell rights from lefts, especially \\nfor the maxillary second premolar, which is, in many \\nother ways, nearly symmetrical.\\n4. MARGINAL RIDGES OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nFrom the lingual view, differences in marginal ridge \\nheights are apparent on handheld teeth when rotating \\nthe tooth just enough one way to see the mesial ridge \\nheight, then just enough in the opposite direction to \\ncompare the distal ridge height. The distal marginal \\nridges of both types of maxillary premolars are more \\ncervical in position than the mesial marginal ridge \\n(recall Appendix 5j).\\n5. ROOTS OF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe lingual root of a two-rooted maxillary first premolar \\nis usually shorter than the buccal root.\\nK Both first and \\nsecond premolar roots taper narrower to the lingual.\\nC. TYPE TRAITS OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE PROXIMAL \\nVIEWS\\nCompare the proximal views of maxillary first and sec-\\nond premolars in Figure 4-7.\\n1. CROWN SHAPE AND MORPHOLOGY \\nOF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nBoth types of maxillary premolars are shaped like \\na trapezoid from the proximal view (Appendix 6b). \\nA trapezoid is a four-sided figure with two parallel sides \\nand two nonparallel sides. Both cusp tips are located \\nover the root and well within the boundary of the root \\noutline, an important relationship imparting good func-\\ntional support for a large chewing area.\\nMaxillary first premolars  have a UNIQUE promi-\\nnent mesial crown concavity  just cervical to the con-\\ntact area, whereas maxillary second premolars  (and \\nmandibular premolars) do not (Appendix 6j). This \\nmesial crown concavity can be seen in almost all max-\\nillary first premolars so it is a consistent and obvious \\ntrait of all maxillary first premolars that can be used to \\ndistinguish it from a maxillary second premolar, and \\ncan be used to confirm the mesial surface on the max-\\nillary first premolar. It is important to remember the \\npresence of this unique mesial crown concavity when \\nrestoring the contours of this surface, or when detect-\\ning and removing calcified deposits from this crown \\nsurface.\\n2. RELATIVE CUSP HEIGHT \\nOF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nFrom this view, as from the lingual, the buccal cusp is \\nnoticeably longer than the lingual cusp on maxillary\\nfirst premolars , compared to the second premolar ,\\nwhich has two cusps of nearly equal length (Appendix \\n6c). This difference is obvious when comparing first \\nand second premolars in Figure 4-7. From the proxi-\\nmal view, it is often a challenge telling buccal from lin-\\ngual on the maxillary second premolar based solely on \\nthe cusp heights, since the cusp heights are so simi-\\nlar. Differences in the heights of contour, however \\n(described next) will be useful for distinguishing buc-\\ncal from lingual surfaces on these teeth.\\n3. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR \\nOF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nLike all teeth, the facial height of contour of maxillary \\npremolars is located in the cervical third. Specifically, \\nit is near the junction of the middle and cervical third. \\nLingually (like other posterior teeth) it is more occlusal, \\nin the middle third (near the center of the crown). This \\ntrait helps distinguish the buccal from lingual sur-\\nfaces on the majority of maxillary premolars from the \\nproximal views in Figure 4-7.'),\n",

DISTANCE BETWEEN CUSP TIPS ON \\nMAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM THE \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe average distance between the buccal and lingual \\ncusp tips of maxillary first and second premolars is \\nabout the same.\\nL\\n5. MARGINAL RIDGE GROOVES OF \\nMAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM THE \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nMarginal ridge grooves serves as a spillway for food \\nduring mastication (best seen from the occlusal view in \\nAppendix 6k). The mesial marginal ridge of the maxil-\\nlary first premolar is almost always crossed by a devel-\\nopmental groove called a mesial marginal ridge groove\\nthat may extend onto the mesial crown surface.\\nM The \\ndistal marginal ridge of this tooth, and the mesial and \\ndistal marginal ridges of the maxillary second premo-\\nlars, are less likely to have marginal ridge grooves, and, \\nwhen present, these grooves are less likely to extend \\nonto the proximal surfaces.\\n6. CERVICAL LINES OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS WHEN COMPARING \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe cervical line on the mesial side of both types of \\nmaxillary premolars curves occlusally in a broad, but \\nshallow arc. As on anterior teeth, the mesial curvature \\nis slightly greater than the distal curvature.\\nN The cervi-\\ncal line on the lingual surface of the maxillary first pre-\\nmolar is in a more occlusal position than on the buccal \\nsurface. This accentuates the appearance that the lin-\\ngual cusp is definitely shorter than the buccal cusp.\\n7. ROOTS AND ROOT DEPRESSIONS OF \\nMAXILLARY PREMOLARS FROM THE \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe roots of both types of maxillary premolars are \\nlikely to have both mesial and distal root depressions \\nof varying depths. Knowledge of the relative location \\nand depth of these depressions can be helpful clinically \\nwhen using dental instruments in the gingival sulcus \\nto detect and remove calcified deposits that contribute \\nto periodontal disease, and when identifying areas of \\ndecay on accessible root surfaces.\\nRecall that maxillary first premolars  most often \\nhave two roots with the lingual root slightly shorter \\nthan the buccal root. The split into two roots (bifurca-\\ntion) occurs in the apical third of the root. As stated \\npreviously, this is the only premolar with an obvious \\ncrown concavity or depression on the mesial surface of \\nits crown, and this depression continues onto the root \\n(seen on all teeth studied). O On maxillary first premo-\\nlars with either one or two roots, this crown depression \\nis continuous with a prominent mesial root depression.O\\nThis important type trait is seen clearly on the mesial \\nviews of all maxillary first premolars in Figure 4-7. \\nThere is also a less distinct distal root depression found \\non both double- and single-rooted first premolars. This \\ndistal depression is located on the middle third of the \\nundivided portion of the root but does not usually \\nextend close to the cervical line. The root of the max-\\nillary first premolar is UNIQUE in that it is the only \\npremolar type where the mesial-side longitudinal root \\ndepression is deeper than on the distal surface.\\nThe maxillary second premolar  usually has one \\nroot with longitudinal root depressions located in the \\nmiddle third of the mesial and distal root surfaces. \\nHowever, its mesial root depression does not extend \\nonto the crown.\\nP The distal root depression is usually \\ndeeper than on the mesial root surface. This feature is \\nthe opposite from the maxillary first premolar, where \\nthe mesial mid-root depression is deeper.\\nD. TYPE TRAITS OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE OCCLUSAL \\nVIEW\\nCompare occlusal views of maxillary first and second \\npremolars in Figure 4-8. To follow this description, the \\nteeth or tooth models you are using should be held as \\nthose displayed in Figure 4-8, so that the buccal surface \\nis at the top and you are sighting down along the verti-\\ncal mid-root axis.\\n1. RELATIVE SIZE OF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEWS\\nIn the same mouth, maxillary first premolars were \\nlarger than adjacent second premolars a little over half \\nof the time.\\nQ\\n2. GROOVES AND FOSSAE OF MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nCharacteristically, central developmental grooves run \\nmesiodistally across the center of both types of maxil-\\nlary premolars extending from a mesial pit to a distal \\npit. The length of the central groove of the maxillary\\nfirst premolar is relatively longer (more than one third \\nof the mesiodistal outline width) than the groove on the \\nmaxillary second premolar (Appendix 6l).\\nR Because the \\ncentral groove on the maxillary first premolar is longer, \\nthe pits are farther apart and are relatively closer to the \\nmarginal ridges than on maxillary second premolars.'),\n",

This \\nlonger central groove on the maxillary first premolar is \\naccentuated by the mesial marginal ridge groove  that \\nalmost always crosses the mesial marginal ridge. It is \\ncontinuous with the central groove and often crosses \\nonto the mesial tooth surface (seen on the drawing in \\nFig. 4-8). Marginal ridge grooves are much less com-\\nmon on the mesial marginal ridge of maxillary second \\npremolars and the distal marginal ridges of either type \\nof maxillary premolar.\\nThere are more supplemental grooves on maxillary sec-\\nond premolars than on maxillary first premolars.

OUTLINE OF MAXILLARY PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nOn both types of maxillary premolars, the lingual half \\nof the tooth is narrower mesiodistally than the buc-\\ncal half, more so on first premolars. From the occlusal \\naspect, the buccal outline of the maxillary first pre-\\nmolar is a rounded and almost V-shape because of the \\nprominent buccal ridge, but this ridge is less prominent \\non the second premolar as seen in Figure 4-8. On both\\ntypes, the tip of the lingual cusp is slightly mesial to the \\ncenter of the tooth.\\nSeen from the occlusal aspect, the maxillary second \\npremolar is typically quite symmetrical (similar shape \\nfor the mesial and distal halves). Its occlusal outline is \\nsmoother and less angular than that of the first premo-\\nlar (Fig. 4-9B).\\nAn asymmetrical occlusal outline is a distinguish-\\ning feature of the maxillary first premolar  that dis-\\ntinguishes it from second premolars (compare outline \\nshapes in Appendix 6m). Part of this asymmetry is due \\nto the apparent “twisting” of the lingual half of the \\ntooth to the mesial, with the lingual cusp tip mesial to \\nthe midline, and the buccal cusp tip actually located \\ndistal to the midline (UNIQUE to the maxillary first \\npremolar with its mesial cusp ridge longer than its dis-\\ntal cusp ridge) ( Fig. 4-9A ). This twisting results in a \\nmesial marginal ridge that joins the mesial cusp ridge \\nof the buccal cusp at an almost right angle (not so on \\nsecond premolars), and a mesial surface that forms \\na nearly straight or concave outline buccolingually \\nrather than a more uniform taper like on the second \\npremolar. This mesial outline concavity may be accen-\\ntuated by the depression of the mesial marginal ridge \\ngroove and mesial crown concavity next to the root. \\nThis straighter mesial marginal ridge appears shorter \\nbuccolingually than the more convex distal marginal \\nridge (note this characteristic on the occlusal surfaces \\nof most maxillary first premolars) (Fig. 4-8).\\nCompare the symmetrical outline of the maxillary \\nsecond premolar to the asymmetrical outline of the \\nmaxillary second premolar in Figure 4-9C.\\nAB Mesial\\nDistal\\nMesial\\nDistal\\nC\\nFIGURE 4-9. A. Note the asymmetrical outline of the maxillary left first premolar, and the location of the buccal cusp tip distal to \\nthe tooth center. B.

TYPE TRAITS OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL \\nVIEW\\nFor the lingual aspect, refer to lingual views of man-\\ndibular first and second premolars in Figure 4-14.\\n1. CROWN SHAPE OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nOn mandibular first premolars , as on most teeth, the \\ncrown is much narrower mesiodistally on the lingual \\nhalf than on the buccal half. This can also be seen on \\nsecond premolars with one lingual cusp. However, the \\nwidth of the lingual half of a second premolar with two \\nlingual cusps is usually as wide or wider mesiodistally \\nthan the buccal half. ONLY this three-cusp mandibu-\\nlar second premolar and some maxillary first molars \\nhave their crowns wider on the lingual half than on the \\nbuccal half.\\n2. LINGUAL CUSPS AND GROOVES \\nOF MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe lingual cusp of a mandibular first premolar  is \\nquite small and short and is often pointed at the tip. It \\nis nonfunctional, and could be considered a transition \\nbetween the canine cingulum and more prominent lin-\\ngual cusp (or cusps) of the second premolar (best appre-\\nciated from the proximal views in Fig. 4-17). Much of \\nthe occlusal surface of this tooth can be seen from the \\nlingual aspect because of the most obvious shortness of \\nthe lingual cusp. This tooth may have almost no lingual \\ncusp or as many as four lingual cusplets.\\nOn mandibular second premolars  with one lingual \\ncusp, the single lingual cusp is smaller than the buccal \\ncusp, but it is relatively larger (longer and wider) than \\nthe lingual cusp of the first premolar. The single lingual \\ncusp tip is most often just mesial to the center line of the \\nroot (Appendix 6q). In the two lingual cusp variation, \\nthere is one large buccal and two smaller lingual cusps. \\nThe mesiolingual cusp is almost always larger and lon-\\nger than the distolingual cusp, but this difference may \\nbe little or great.\\nAA The mesiolingual cusp tip is mesial\\nto the midline of the root, similar to the  lingual cusp of \\na two cusp premolar.\\n3. MARGINAL RIDGES OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nFrom the lingual view , differences in marginal ridge \\nheights are apparent on handheld teeth when rotat-\\ning the tooth first enough in one direction to see the \\nmesial marginal ridge height, then enough in the \\nopposite direction to compare the distal ridge height. \\nAs with most other posterior teeth, the distal mar-\\nginal ridges of the mandibular second premolars  are \\nslightly more cervically located than the mesial mar-\\nginal ridges as is evident on all mandibular second \\npremolars in Figure 4-14. An EXCEPTION to all other \\nadult teeth is the mandibular first premolar , the only \\ntooth where the mesial marginal ridge is more cervi-\\ncally located than the distal marginal ridge as is evident \\nin Figure 4-14 for many mandibular first premolars. \\nThis is similar to the UNIQUE relative location of the \\nmesial proximal contact  of the mandibular first pre-\\nmolar (more cervical) and the distal proximal contact \\n(more occlusal).\\n4. GROOVES ON MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThis difference in grooves extending onto the lingual \\nsurfaces of first and second mandibular premolars is \\nseen best on occlusal views in Figure 4-15 . On man-\\ndibular first premolars, there is frequently a mesiolin-\\ngual groove separating the mesial marginal ridge from \\nthe mesial slope of the small lingual cusp.\\nBB (Rarely, a \\nsimilar groove might be present between the distal mar-\\nginal ridge and the distal slope of the lingual cusp.) On \\nmandibular second premolars with two lingual cusps, \\na lingual groove passes between the mesiolingual and \\ndistolingual cusps, and may extend slightly onto the \\nlingual surface of the crown.\\nFIGURE 4-13.

CROWN SHAPE OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nMandibular premolars are shaped like a rhomboid from \\nthe proximal view (Appendix 6b). A rhomboid is a four-\\nsided figure with opposite sides parallel to one another, \\nlike a parallelogram. As on all mandibular posterior \\nteeth, the crowns of the mandibular first premolars\\ntilt noticeably toward the lingual surface at the cervix \\n(much more than any other premolar). This tilt places \\nthe tip of the buccal cusp almost over the mid-root \\naxis line (obvious on all mandibular first premolars in \\nFig. 4-16). As was also seen from the lingual aspect, the \\nlingual cusp of the mandibular first premolar is con-\\nsiderably shorter than the buccal cusp by more than \\none third of the total crown length.\\nZ Since it is so short, \\nit is considered a nonfunctioning cusp (Appendix 6p). \\nThe lingual cusp tip is so lingually positioned that it is \\nusually aligned vertically with the lingual outline of the \\ncervical portion of the root. The short lingual cusp also \\nresults in an occlusal plane than approaches 45° rela-\\ntive to the long axis of the root.\\nThe mandibular second premolar  crowns (both \\ntypes) also tip lingually, but not as much as on the \\nmandibular first premolar. The tip of the buccal cusp \\nof the mandibular second premolar is usually located \\nat the junction of the buccal and middle thirds. As with \\nthe first premolar, the tip of the lingual cusp (or of the \\nmesiolingual cusp) of this second premolar is usually \\nabout on a vertical line with the lingual surface of the \\nroot at the cementoenamel junction. A comparison of \\nthe lingual tilt of a mandibular first and second premo-\\nlar is seen in Figure 4-17.\\nThe lingual cusps (or mesiolingual cusps for three-\\ncusp types) of mandibular second premolars are closer \\nin length to the buccal cusp than on first premolars.\\nDD\\nWhen the three-cusp type is viewed from the mesial, the \\nlonger mesiolingual cusp conceals the shorter distolingual \\ncusp, while viewing from the distal, both lingual cusp tips \\nare usually visible (as seen on several mandibular second \\npremolars viewed from the distal in Fig. 4-16).\\n2. RIDGES OF MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nThe mesial marginal ridge of the mandibular first pre-\\nmolar slopes cervically from the buccal toward the \\ncenter of the occlusal surface at nearly a 45° angle and \\nis nearly parallel to the triangular ridge of the buccal \\ncusp (Fig. 4-18 and Appendix 6s).

The dif-\\nference in marginal ridge angle and height is most help-\\nful in differentiating rights from lefts (by identifying the \\nmore downward sloping and more cervical mesial mar-\\nginal ridge). The triangular ridge of the lingual cusp is \\nshort and is in a nearly horizontal plane.\\nThe more horizontal mesial marginal ridge of the \\nmandibular second premolar is more occlusally located \\nthan the distal marginal ridge, which is more concave \\nand definitely in a more cervical position (compare \\nmesial and distal views in Fig. 4-16).\\n3.

When viewed from the \\ndistal, there is only rarely a groove between the distal \\nmarginal ridge and the distal slope of the lingual cusp.\\nBB\\nMesiolingual grooves are not present on mandibu-\\nlar second premolars, but the marginal ridges on these \\nteeth may infrequently be crossed by a marginal ridge \\ngroove (very rarely on the distal marginal ridge).\\nEE\\nOn premolars with two lingual cusps, the shorter \\ndistolingual cusp may be seen from the distal view but \\nnot the mesial view (Fig. 4-16).\\n4. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR \\nOF MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nAs on all teeth, the height of contour on the buccal sur-\\nface of both types of mandibular premolar crowns is \\nin the cervical third. On the mandibular first premo-\\nlar, the buccal height of contour of the crown is just \\nocclusal to the cervical line like the mandibular canine \\nnext to it, and its buccal crown outline is convex in its \\nocclusal two thirds (Fig. 4-16). The buccal height of \\ncontour on the mandibular second premolar is near the \\njunction of the cervical and middle thirds, and its buc-\\ncal crown contour is flatter in its occlusal two thirds.\\nFor all mandibular premolars, the height of contour \\nof the lingual surface of the crown is in the middle third, \\nabout in the center of the total crown length. On the \\nmandibular first premolar, this is not far from the cusp \\ntip of the lingual cusp (clearly seen on mandibular first \\npremolars in Fig. 4-16). Because of the extreme lingual \\ntilting of the crown, the lingual surfaces of all mandibu-\\nlar premolar crowns extend lingually , well beyond the \\nlingual surface of the root.\\nFIGURE 4-17.

CERVICAL LINES OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nSimilar to other teeth, the occlusal curve of the cervical \\nline on the proximal surfaces of all premolars is slightly \\ngreater on the mesial surface than on the distal.\\nFF The \\ncervical line is also located more occlusally on the lin-\\ngual than on the buccal. This makes the crowns appear \\nto be quite short on the lingual side.\\n6. ROOTS OF MANDIBULAR PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nBoth types of mandibular premolar roots taper apically, \\nwith the least taper in the cervical third.\\n7. ROOT DEPRESSIONS OF \\nMANDIBULAR PREMOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nMandibular first premolars have a shallow longitudinal \\ndepression in the apical and middle thirds of the mesial\\nroot surface almost half of the time but are more likely \\nto have a longitudinal depression on the distal surface, \\nand this distal depression is most often deeper than on \\nthe mesial.\\nGG Most mandibular second premolars have \\nno depression on the mesial root surface but are likely \\nto have a longitudinal depression in the middle third of \\nthe distal root surface.\\nTo summarize, all types of mandibular and maxillary \\npremolars are, on average, likely to have a more promi-\\nnent root depression on the distal root surface than on \\nthe mesial EXCEPT the maxillary first premolar, which \\nis more likely to have its more prominent root depres-\\nsion on the mesial surface. See Table 4-5 for a summary \\nof the location and relative depth of root depressions \\non all types of premolars.\\nD. TYPE TRAITS OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE OCCLUSAL \\nVIEW\\nFor the occlusal view of mandibular first and second \\npremolars, refer to Figure 4-19. To follow this descrip-\\ntion, the teeth or tooth models should be held with \\nthe occlusal surface toward the observer and the buc-\\ncal surface up, and the observer looking exactly along \\nthe vertical mid-root axis. Much of the buccal surface \\nis visible from this view since the tip of the buccal \\ncusp is slightly buccal to tooth center from this view \\n(clearly seen in almost all mandibular first premolars \\nin Fig. 4-19).\\n1. OUTLINE SHAPE OF MANDIBULAR \\nPREMOLARS FROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nThere is much variation in the occlusal morphology of \\nmandibular first premolars.\\n2 The outline of the crown \\nis usually not symmetrical (more bulk in the distal \\nhalf) as seen in practically all mandibular first premo-\\nlars in Figure 4-19. It often looks as though the mesio-\\nlingual portion of the crown outline has been pushed in\\n(Appendix 6u). This results in a somewhat diamond-\\nshaped outline (also Appendix 6u).

The contact areas, as \\nseen from the occlusal view , are at the point of broad-\\nest mesiodistal dimension just lingual to this line of the \\nbuccal cusp ridges. On the mandibular first premolar, \\nthe buccal ridge is not prominent, and the buccal crest \\nof contour, like the buccal cusp tip, is slightly mesial \\nto center. The crest of contour of the lingual surface is \\noften distal to the middle mesiodistally of the tooth.\\nOn the two-cusp second premolars, the crown out-\\nline is round or oval shaped, but with a relatively square\\nocclusal table. The crown outline tapers to the lingual, \\nso the crown outline is more broadly curved on the buc-\\ncal side than on the lingual side. The lingual cusp tip is \\noften off center toward the mesial half of the crown.\\nOn the three-cusp second premolars , the occlusal \\noutline is more nearly square than is the occlusal out-\\nline of the two-cusp type because its crown is wider lin-\\ngually with two lingual cusps.

Further, more than half of the time, three-\\ncusp premolar teeth have greater faciolingual bulk in \\nthe distal than mesial half of the crown (tapering smaller \\nfrom distal to mesial), which is an EXCEPTION to the \\nnormal taper to the distal\\nHH (Fig. 4-21).

OCCLUSAL MORPHOLOGY OF \\nMANDIBULAR PREMOLARS FROM \\nTHE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\na. Ridges, Fossae, and Grooves of the \\nMandibular \\nFirst Premolars from the Occlusal View\\nDue to the much larger buccal than lingual cusp on the \\nmandibular first premolar , the triangular ridge of the \\nbuccal cusp is long and slopes lingually from the cusp \\ntip to where it joins the very short triangular ridge of \\nthe lingual cusp. Most often the two triangular ridges \\nunite smoothly near the center of the occlusal surface \\nand form an uninterrupted very prominent transverse \\nridge that completely separates the mesial and distal \\nfossae. The mesial fossa is more linear buccolingually , \\nbut the distal fossa is more frequently larger or deeper.\\nII\\nEach fossa has a pit. Both of these deep pits are suscep-\\ntible to decay (caries) and are therefore often restored \\nwith two separate restorations (Fig. 4-23).\\nOnly rarely is the pronounced transverse ridge of the \\nmandibular first premolar crossed by a fissured central \\ngroove, which may extend from the mesial pit across \\nthe transverse ridge to the distal pit. More commonly, \\nthere are mesial and distal developmental grooves run-\\nning in a nearly buccolingual direction, flaring buc-\\ncally from the mesial and distal fossae ( Fig. 4-24). The \\nmesiolingual groove (when present) may appear to be \\ncontinuous with this mesial groove.\\nb. Ridges, Fossae, and Grooves of the \\nTwo-Cusp Mandibular Second Premolars\\nfrom the Occlusal View\\nOn the two-cusp type mandibular second premolar ,\\nas on the mandibular first premolar, the lingual cusp is \\nsmaller than the buccal cusp.

FUNCTIONS OF MOLARS\\nThe permanent molars, like the premolars, (a) play \\na major role in the mastication of food (chewing and \\ngrinding to pulverize) and (b) are most important in \\nmaintaining the vertical dimension of the face (prevent-\\ning the jaws from closing too far, which could reduce \\nthe vertical dimension between the chin and the nose, \\nresulting in a protruding chin and a prematurely aged \\nappearance). They are also (c) important in maintain-\\ning continuity within the dental arches, thus keeping \\nother teeth in proper alignment. Further, molars have \\n(d) at least a minor role in esthetics or keeping the \\ncheeks normally full or supported. You may have seen \\nsomeone who has lost all 12 molars (six upper and six \\nlower) and has sunken cheeks.\\nThe loss of a first molar is really noticed and missed \\nby most people when it has been extracted. More than \\n80 mm\\n2 of efficient chewing surface is gone; the tongue \\nfeels the huge space between the remaining teeth; \\nand during mastication of coarse or brittle foods, the \\nattached gingiva in the region of the missing molar \\noften becomes abraded and uncomfortable. Loss of six \\nor more molars could even lead to problems in the jaw \\njoints (temporomandibular joints or TMJ).\\nC. CLASS TRAITS FOR MOLARS\\nRefer to Appendix page 7 while reading about the fol-\\nlowing class traits of all molars.\\n1. CROWN SIZE FOR ALL MOLARS\\nMolars have an occlusal (chewing) surface with three \\nto five cusps, and their occlusal surfaces are larger than \\nthe other teeth in their respective arches. They have \\nbroader occlusal surfaces than premolars, both facio-\\nlingually and mesiodistally.\\nA The combined mesiodistal \\nwidth of the three mandibular molars in one quadrant \\nmakes up over half of the mesiodistal dimension of \\ntheir quadrant. The maxillary molars constitute 44% of \\ntheir quadrant’s mesiodistal dimension, still a signifi-\\ncant portion. In contrast, both mandibular and max-\\nillary molar crowns are shorter occlusocervically than \\nall other adult crowns and are shorter occlusocervically \\nthan mesiodistally (Appendix 7a).\\n2. TAPER FROM BUCCAL TO LINGUAL \\nFOR MOST MOLARS\\nFrom the occlusal view , molar crowns taper (get nar-\\nrower) from the buccal to the lingual. That is, the mesi-\\nodistal width on the buccal half is wider than on the \\nlingual half (Appendix 7b), EXCEPT on maxillary first \\nmolars with large distolingual cusps, where crowns \\nactually taper narrower from lingual toward the  buccal.\\n3. TAPER TO THE DISTAL \\nFOR MOST MOLARS\\nFor both arches, molar crowns from the occlusal view \\ntend to taper distally , so that the distal third is narrower \\nbuccolingually than the mesial third (Appendix 7c). \\nThis taper may be less apparent on mandibular first \\nmolars where the tooth may be widest buccolingually \\nin the middle third. Also, from the buccal (or lingual) \\nviews, the occlusal surfaces of all molars slope shorter \\ntoward the cervix from mesial to distal (Appendix \\n7d). This, along with the more cervical placement of \\nthe distal marginal ridge, makes more of the occlusal \\nsurface visible from the distal aspect than from the \\nmesial aspect (compare mesial to distal views in \\nAppendix page 7).\\n4. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR \\nFOR ALL MOLARS\\nAs with premolars, the height of contour on the buccal\\nof molars viewed from the proximal is in the cervical \\nthird; on the lingual, it is most often in the middle third \\n(Appendix 7e).\\n5. CONTACT AREAS FOR ALL MOLARS\\nThe contact areas on all molars viewed from the buccal \\n(or lingual) are at or near the junction of the occlusal \\nand middle thirds mesially and are more cervical on the \\ndistal (in the middle third near the middle of the tooth) \\n(Appendix 7f).\\nD. ARCH TRAITS THAT DIFFERENTIATE \\nMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS\\nCompare extracted maxillary and mandibular molars \\nand/or tooth models while reading about these dif-\\nferentiating arch traits. Also refer to page 8 in the \\nAppendix.\\n1. CROWN OUTLINE TO DISTINGUISH \\nMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR MOLARS\\nFrom the occlusal view , the crowns of mandibular\\nmolars are oblong: they are characteristically much \\nwider mesiodistally than faciolingually . B This is just \\nthe opposite of the maxillary molars, which have their \\ngreater dimension faciolingually . From the occlusal \\nview , maxillary molars have a more square or twisted \\nparallelogram shape. Mandibular molars have a some-\\nwhat rectangular shape, and on mandibular first molars, \\nthe outline may be pentagon shape (compare the outline \\nshapes on Appendix 8k).'),\n",

NUMBERS AND RELATIVE SIZE OF CUSPS \\n(AND NUMBER OF LOBES)\\nMandibular molar crowns normally have four or five \\ncusps. Many have four relatively large cusps: two buccal \\n(mesiobuccal and distobuccal) and two lingual (mesio-\\nlingual and distolingual). However, most mandibular \\nfirst molars often have an additional fifth, smaller cusp \\ncalled a distal cusp that is located on the buccal sur-\\nface just distal to the distobuccal cusp. The two lingual\\ncusps of mandibular molars are of nearly equal size, \\nwhich is different than on maxillary molars where dis-\\ntolingual cusps are often considerably smaller.\\nThe crowns of maxillary molars may have three to \\nfive cusps. When they have four cusps, three are larger \\n(the mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and mesiolingual) and \\nthe fourth is smaller (the distolingual) or, on many \\nmaxillary second molars, it is missing resulting in three \\ncusps. On many maxillary first molars, there is a fifth, \\nmuch smaller cusp (cusp of Carabelli) located on the \\nlingual surface of the longest and largest mesiolingual \\ncusp (Appendix 8i).\\nThe number of lobes forming molars is one per cusp, \\nincluding the cusp of Carabelli.

CROWN TILT THAT DISTINGUISHES \\nMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS\\nWhen mandibular molar  crowns are examined from \\nthe proximal views, the crowns appear to be tilted lin-\\ngually on the root trunk (true for all mandibular poste-\\nrior teeth), whereas the crowns and cusps of maxillary\\nmolars are centered over their roots (Appendix 8b). \\nAlso, when mandibular molars  are viewed from the \\nbuccal, the considerable bulge of the distal crown out-\\nline beyond the cervix of the root, and the slope of the \\nocclusal surface shorter on the distal, may appear as \\nthough the crown is tipped distally relative to the long \\naxis of the root.

ROOTS TO DISTINGUISH \\nMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS\\nPerhaps the most obvious trait to differentiate extracted \\nmaxillary from mandibular molars is the number of \\nroots. Maxillary molars  have three relatively long \\nroots: mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and lingual (palatal). \\nThe lingual root is usually the longest; the distobuccal \\nroot is the shortest. The roots converge into a broad \\ncervical root trunk. Mandibular molars have only two\\nroots: a long mesial root and a slightly shorter distal \\nroot. Mandibular molars have the longest roots rela-\\ntive to crown length (greatest root-to-crown ratio) of \\nany adult teeth.\\nC The root furcation on lower molars \\nis usually close to the cervical line (especially on first \\nmolars), making the root trunk shorter than on the \\nmaxillary molars (see Appendix 8c).\\nT able 5-2 includes a summary of arch traits that can \\nbe used to differentiate maxillary from mandibular \\nmolars.\\nTable 5-2 ARCH TRAITS TO DISTINGUISH MANDIBULAR FROM MAXILLARY MOLARS (Continued)\\nMAXILLARY MOLARS MANDIBULAR MOLARS\\nOCCLUSAL VIEW\\nCrowns wider faciolingually than mesiodistal Crowns wider mesiodistally than faciolingual\\nOblique ridge present from mesiolingual to distobuccal No oblique ridge\\nOne transverse ridge mesiobuccal to mesiolingual Two transverse ridges mesiobuccal to mesiolingual and \\ndistobuccal to distolingual\\nParallelogram (or square) shape crown for four-cusp \\ntype\\nPentagon shape crown on firsts\\nThree-cusp seconds are heart shaped Rectangular shape crown on seconds\\nFour fossae: including large central and cigar-shaped \\ndistal\\nThree fossae: central fossa is large\\nCentral groove in mesial half does not cross oblique \\nridge\\nCentral fossa with zigzag or + groove pattern\\nFirst molars have four cusps plus Carabelli cusp/groove Five cusps on firsts (distal cusp is fifth cusp)\\nFirst molars wider on lingual than buccal First molars wider on buccal than lingual\\nSecond molars have four cusps or three cusps (heart \\nshaped)\\nSecond molars have four cusps\\nMesiolingual cusp much larger than distolingual Mesiolingual cusp slightly larger than distolingual\\nMandibular first and second molars have specific traits \\nthat can be used to distinguish one from the other.

TYPE TRAITS OF MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS FROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 5-2  for similarities and differences \\nbetween mandibular first and second molars.\\n1. CROWN PROPORTIONS FROM \\nTHE BUCCAL VIEW\\nFor both types of mandibular molars, the crowns are \\nwider mesiodistally than high cervico-occlusally but \\nmore so on the larger first molars.\\nD\\n2. RELATIVE NUMBER AND SIZE \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLAR CUSPS \\n(AND GROOVES THAT SEPARATE THEM) \\nFROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThe mandibular first molar  has the largest mesiodistal \\ndimension of any tooth. E,F It most often has five cusps: \\nthree buccal and two lingual ( Fig. 5-3), but the small-\\nest distal cusp may be absent about a fifth of the time \\n(Fig. 5-4 ).\\nG Consequently , not all four-cusp molars are \\nsecond molars. Almost one fifth may be mandibular first \\nmolars.\\nWhen there are five cusps, their heights, in order \\nfrom longest to shortest, are mesiolingual, distolingual, \\nmesiobuccal, distobuccal, then the smallest distal cusp \\n(located on the buccal surface near the distobuccal angle). \\nThe mesiobuccal cusp is the largest, widest, and highest \\ncusp on the buccal side of the tooth.\\nH The  distobuccal \\ncusp may be sharper than the mesiobuccal cusp.I\\nFrom the buccal view, the mesiolingual cusp of the \\nmandibular first molar, which is the highest or longest of \\nall the cusps of the mandibular first molar, is just visible \\nbehind the mesiobuccal cusp. The distolingual cusp tip \\nis visible behind the distobuccal cusp and is usually the \\nsecond highest cusp when the tooth is oriented vertically. \\nThis is clearly seen in the first molars in Figure 5-2. Even \\nthough the lingual cusps are higher than buccal cusps \\nwhen viewing extracted teeth with the root axis held ver-\\ntically, the lingual cusp tips are at a lower level than the \\nbuccal cusps in the mouth due to the lingual tilt of the \\nroot axis in the mandible (creating the curve of mediolat-\\neral curve [of Wilson] shown earlier in Fig. 1-35).\\nWhen there are three buccal cusps on the man-\\ndibular first molar , there are two buccal grooves: \\nthe mesiobuccal and shorter distobuccal. The longer \\nmesiobuccal groove  separates the mesiobuccal cusp \\nfrom the distobuccal cusp and may extend onto the \\nbuccal surface often ending in a deep pit at its cervical \\nend that is sometimes a site of decay. Six of the man-\\ndibular first molars in Figure 5-2 have pits at the end \\nof the mesiobuccal groove, and a seventh has an amal-\\ngam restoration. The shorter\\nJ distobuccal groove  sepa-\\nrates the distobuccal cusp from the distal cusp and may \\nalso end in a pit.

These \\ncusps, in order from longest to shortest, are the mesio-\\nlingual, distolingual, mesiobuccal, and distobuccal, \\nthe same order as for the four larger cusps of the man-\\ndibular first molar. As on the mandibular first molar, \\nthe lingual cusp tips from the buccal view are visible \\nbehind the shorter buccal cusps (seen in most teeth in \\nFig. 5-2).

PROXIMAL CONTACTS OF MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS FROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nBoth types of mandibular molars (in fact, all molars) \\nhave their mesial contact located more occlusally than \\nthe distal, close to the junction of middle and occlusal \\nthirds of the crown.

CERVICAL LINES OF MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS FROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThe cervical lines of both mandibular first and second \\nmolars are often nearly straight across the buccal sur-\\nface. On mandibular molars, cementum often covers \\nthe root bifurcation surface in a mesiodistal direction,\\n1\\nbut sometimes there is a point of enamel that dips down \\nnearly into the root bifurcation ( Fig. 5-5). There may \\neven be a dipping down of enamel on both the buc-\\ncal and the lingual surfaces, and these extensions may \\nmeet in the root bifurcation.\\n3,4 Such enamel extensions \\nmay cause periodontal problems because of the deep \\ngingival sulcus in these regions.\\n5. TAPER OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThere is proportionally more tapering of the crown \\nfrom the contact areas to the cervical line on mandibu-\\nlar first molars than on second molars because of the \\nbulge of the distal cusp (Appendix 8g). Therefore, \\nthe crown of the second molar appears to be wider \\nat the cervix than on the first molar.\\nFIGURE 5-4.

Often the apices of both roots are \\ndirected toward the centerline of the tooth, similar in \\nshape to the handle of pliers (2 of the 10 mandibular \\nmolars in Fig. 5-2; see if you can find them), or both \\nroots may curve distally . The root trunk is slightly lon-\\nger than that of the mandibular first molar (Appendix \\n8f), and the depression of the buccal furcation extends \\nocclusally across the root to the cervical line (Fig. 5-2).\\nB.

NARROWER LINGUAL CROWN \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nAs with most teeth, mandibular first and second molar \\ncrowns taper from buccal to lingual and thus are \\nnarrower on the lingual side.\\n2. RELATIVE SIZE OF MANDIBULAR CUSPS \\n(AND THE LINGUAL GROOVE) FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nSince the lingual cusps of both types of mandibular \\nmolars are both slightly longer (and more pointed) than \\nthe buccal cusps, only the two longer lingual cusps are \\nvisible from the lingual aspect (not evident in Fig. 5-6 \\nbecause of the camera angle). The mesiolingual cusp is \\nmost often slightly wider and longer than the distolin-\\ngual cusp (noticeably wider on first molars).\\nM The lin-\\ngual cusps were rated about even on cusp sharpness.N\\nThe lingual groove that separates the mesiolingual \\nfrom the distolingual cusp may extend onto the lin-\\ngual surface and sometimes it may be fissured and form \\ndecay on the lingual surface.\\n3. CERVICAL LINE OF MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe cervical line on the lingual surface is relatively \\nstraight (mesiodistally) but may dip cervically between \\nthe roots over the bifurcation as is also sometimes seen \\non the buccal side of the crown.\\n4. ROOTS OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nOn mandibular first molars , the root trunk appears \\nlonger on the lingual than on the buccal side because \\nthe cervical line is more occlusal in position on the \\nlingual than on the buccal surface. Both roots are nar-\\nrower on the lingual side than they are on the buccal \\nside, and the mesial root is twisted making it possible \\nto see the mesial surface of the mesial root (seen on five \\nmandibular first molars in Fig. 5-6). One may also see \\nthe distal surface of the distal root because of its taper \\ntoward the lingual.\\nOn both first and second mandibular molars, the \\nshort root trunk has a depression between the bifurca-\\ntion and the cervical line.\\nC. TYPE TRAITS OF MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS FROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nFor proper orientation, as you study each trait, hold the \\ncrown so that the root axis line is in a vertical position \\nas seen in Figure 5-7.\\nRecall that both types of mandibular molar crowns \\nare relatively shorter cervico-occlusally and wider faci-\\nolingually, and that the crowns of both types of man-\\ndibular molars are tilted lingually from the root trunk \\n(Fig. 5-8 ). Remember that this slant is an arch trait \\ncharacteristic of all mandibular posterior teeth and is \\nnature’s way of shaping them to fit beneath and lingual \\nto the maxillary buccal cusps.\\n1. HEIGHT (CREST) OF CONTOUR OF \\nMANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM THE \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nAs with all molars (and premolars), the convex buccal\\nheight of contour or greatest bulge is in the cervical \\nthird (Fig. 5-8). The buccal height of contour is actually \\nformed by the buccal cervical ridge that runs mesiodis-\\ntally near the cervical line. It is more prominent on man-\\ndibular second molars than on firsts. The lingual outline \\nof the crown of both molars appears nearly straight in \\nthe cervical third with its height of contour in the mid-\\ndle third. This difference in heights of contour is useful \\nto distinguish buccal from lingual surfaces.\\n2. CUSP HEIGHT OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nIn review , on the four-cusp mandibular molars , the \\ncusps in order from longest to shortest are mesiolin-\\ngual, distolingual, mesiobuccal, and distobuccal. Since \\ncusps (and marginal ridges) are shorter on the distal \\nthan on the mesial, much of the occlusal surface and all \\ncusp tips can be seen from the distal aspect (as seen on \\nthe distal surfaces of all teeth in Fig. 5-7). On the five-\\ncusp first molar, the shortest distal cusp is also visible \\nfrom the distal.'),\n",

TAPER TOWARD DISTAL \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nOn both types of molars, the crown is narrower in the \\ndistal third than in the mesial third. Therefore, from the \\ndistal aspect, some of the lingual and the buccal surfaces \\ncan be seen (demonstrated clearly on the distal views of \\nmandibular second molars in Fig. 5-7). Proximal con-\\ntact areas may be seen as flattened areas (facets) caused \\nfrom wear due to the rubbing of adjacent teeth during \\nfunctional movements of the jaws. On mandibular first \\nmolars, the distal contact is centered on the distal sur-\\nface cervical to the distal cusp.\\n4. CERVICAL LINES OF THE MANDIBULAR \\nMOLARS WHEN COMPARING \\nPROXIMAL VIEWS\\nMesial cervical lines on both first and second molars \\nslope occlusally from buccal to lingual and curve very \\nslightly toward the occlusal surface.O The distal cervical \\nlines are so slightly curved that they are nearly straight.\\n5.

Distal\\nmarginal ridges of the first molar are short and V shaped, \\nlocated just lingual and distal to the distal cusp.\\nDifferences in mesial and distal marginal ridge \\nheights are apparent on handheld teeth when viewing \\nthe crown from the lingual and rotating the tooth, first \\njust enough in one direction to see the mesial marginal \\nridge height, and then enough in the opposite direction \\nto compare it to the distal marginal ridge height. On \\nmandibular molars, as with all posterior teeth (EXCEPT \\nthe mandibular first premolar), mesial marginal ridges \\nare more occlusally located than distal marginal ridges \\nso that from the mesial view , the triangular ridges are \\nmostly hidden from view .\\n6. ROOTS AND ROOT DEPRESSIONS \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nFrom the mesial aspect, the mesial root of the mandibu-\\nlar first molar is broad buccolingually with a blunt wide \\napex, compared to the mesial root of the mandibular\\nsecond molar that is often narrower buccolingually , and \\nmore pointed at the apex. The distal roots of both first \\nand second mandibular molars are less broad buccolin-\\ngually , more pointed at the apex, and shorter than the \\nmesial roots. Therefore, from the distal view , the broader \\nmesial root is usually visible behind the narrower distal \\nroot, and from the mesial view , the narrower distal root \\nis hidden (seen clearly on all but one mandibular sec-\\nond molar from the  distal view in Fig. 5-7).\\nThere is usually a deep depression on the mesial \\nsurface of the mesial root  on both mandibular first and \\nsecond molars extending from the cervical line to the \\napex, indicating the likelihood of two root canals in \\nthis broad root, one buccal and one lingual (as seen \\nin cross-section views in Fig. 5-9 ).

NUMBERS AND SIZE OF CUSPS \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM \\nTHE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nAs stated earlier, most mandibular second molars have \\nfour cusps: two on the buccal (mesiobuccal and disto-\\nbuccal) and two on the lingual (mesiolingual and disto-\\nlingual). Most mandibular first molars have five cusps: \\nthree on the buccal (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and \\nthe smallest distal cusp closest to the distal marginal \\nridge) and two on the lingual (mesiolingual and disto-\\nlingual). On both types of mandibular molars, the two \\nmesial cusps (mesiobuccal and mesiolingual) are larger \\nthan the two distal cusps (distobuccal and distolingual) \\n(Fig. 5-11), and the fifth, distal cusp on first molars is \\nthe smallest.\\n2. OUTLINE SHAPE AND TAPER \\nOF MANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM \\nTHE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nAs stated previously , both types of mandibular molars \\nare wider mesiodistally than faciolingually .Q The man-\\ndibular second molar  outline is roughly a four-sided \\nrectangle, whereas on the first molar, the widest por-\\ntion of the tooth may be located in the middle third on \\nthe prominent buccal bulge of its distobuccal cusp, so \\nthe outline would be more like a five-sided pentagon\\n(Appendix 8k).\\nThe crown outlines of both types of mandibular \\nmolars taper lingually , so they are wider  mesiodistally\\non the buccal half than on the lingual half (recall \\nAppendix 7b and c). Mandibular molar crowns also \\ntaper narrower from mesial to distal, so they are wider \\nbuccolingually on the mesial half than on the distal \\nhalf. This wider buccolingual dimension on the mesial \\nhalf of the mandibular second molar  is due primarily \\nto the prominent buccal cervical ridge that is most evi-\\ndent on the mesiobuccal cusp outline (Fig. 5-11). This \\nbulge is a consistent landmark useful for identifying the \\nmesiobuccal cusp on the buccal surface of the some-\\nwhat symmetrical mandibular second molars in Figure \\n5-11 and evident on most mandibular second molars in \\nFigure 5-10.\\n3. RIDGES OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nOn both first and second mandibular molars, the \\ntriangular ridges of the mesiobuccal and mesiolin-\\ngual cusps join to form a (mesial) transverse ridge, \\nand the triangular ridges of the distobuccal and disto-\\nlingual cusps form a second (distal) transverse ridge \\n(Fig. 5-12 ).\\nFIGURE 5-11.

FOSSAE OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nThere are three fossae on both types of mandibular \\nmolars: the largest central fossa (approximately in the \\ncenter of the tooth), a smaller mesial triangular fossa \\n(just inside the mesial marginal ridge), and the smallest \\ndistal triangular fossa (just inside the distal marginal \\nridge; it is very small on second molars). These fossae \\nare shaded red in Figures 5-11 (on a second molar) \\nand 5-13 (on a first molar). There may be a pit at the \\njunction of grooves in the deepest portion of any of \\nthese fossae.\\n5. GROOVES OF MANDIBULAR MOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nThe pattern of major grooves on mandibular second \\nmolars is simpler than that on first molars. It is made \\nup of three major grooves: a central groove running \\nmesiodistally , plus a buccal and a lingual groove. The \\ncentral groove  starts in the mesial triangular fossa, \\npasses through the central fossa, and ends in the distal \\ntriangular fossa. Its mesiodistal course is straighter than \\non mandibular first molars. The buccal groove separates \\nthe mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps and extends \\nonto the buccal surface. The lingual groove separates the \\nmesiolingual and the distolingual cusps but does not \\nusually extend onto the lingual surface. The buccal and \\nlingual grooves line up to form an almost continuous \\ngroove running from buccal to lingual that intersects \\nwith the central groove in the central fossa (Fig. 5-11). \\nThe resultant groove pattern resembles a cross (or +) \\n(Appendix 8, occlusal view of the mandibular second \\nmolar).\\nMajor grooves on the mandibular first molar  sepa-\\nrate five cusps instead of four, so the pattern is slightly \\nmore complicated (Fig. 5-13). As on second molars, the \\ncentral groove passes from the mesial triangular fossa \\nthrough the central fossa to the distal triangular fossa. \\nThe central groove may be more zigzag or crooked in \\nits mesiodistal course. The lingual groove starts at the \\ncentral groove in the central fossa and extends lin-\\ngually between the mesiolingual and the distolingual \\ncusps, but it is rare for a prominent lingual groove to \\nextend onto the lingual surface. Instead of one buc-\\ncal groove, the mandibular first molar has two. Like \\nthe buccal groove on mandibular second molars, this \\nmesiobuccal groove  separates the mesiobuccal and dis-\\ntobuccal cusps. It starts at the central groove, in or \\njust mesial to the central fossa, and extends onto the \\nbuccal surface. This groove may be nearly continuous \\nwith the lingual groove, or it may not join with it. The \\ndistobuccal groove , unique to the first molar, starts at \\nthe central groove between the central fossa and the \\ndistal triangular fossa and extends between the dis-\\ntobuccal and the distal cusps often onto the buccal \\nsurface.\\nOver half of mesial marginal ridges and over a third \\nof distal marginal ridges of mandibular molars are \\ncrossed by marginal ridge grooves.\\nR Some mandibu-\\nlar first molars in Figure 5-10 have mesial marginal \\nridge grooves, but fewer have distal marginal ridge \\ngrooves.\\nOn mandibular first and second molars, there may \\nbe supplemental (extra, minor) grooves. All grooves \\nprovide important escape-ways for food as it is crushed. \\nSupplemental ridges are located between  supplemental\\nand major grooves and serve as additional cutting \\nblades. Without these ridges and grooves, the teeth \\nwould be inefficient crushers and subject to unfavor-\\nable forces during chewing. Brand and Isselhard state \\nthat mandibular second molars have more secondary \\ngrooves than first molars.\\n5\\n6. PROXIMAL CONTACT AREAS OF \\nMANDIBULAR MOLARS FROM THE \\nOCCLUSAL VIEW\\nThe mesial and distal contact areas of mandibular first \\nand second molars are normally slightly buccal to the \\nmiddle of the tooth. Therefore, when molars are in con-\\ntact with adjacent teeth, the space (embrasure) lingual \\nto the contact is longer (larger) than the space buccal \\nto the contact. Mesial contact areas on mandibular first \\nmolars are just buccal to the center buccolingually , \\nwhereas distal contacts are just lingual to the distal \\ncusp. On mandibular second molars , mesial contacts \\nare near the junction of the middle and buccal thirds, \\nwhereas the distal contacts are just buccal to the center \\nbuccolingually (Fig. 5-11).\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nLearning exercise related to mandibular molars:\\nExamine your mouth and the mouths of a few of \\nyour associates to determine if the mandibular \\nfirst molars have four or five cusps, and if the sec-\\nond molars have four cusps. Also, see if their first \\nmolars are larger than their seconds, and seconds \\nare larger than their thirds.'),\n",

TYPE TRAITS OF THE MAXILLARY \\nMOLARS FROM THE BUCCAL \\nVIEW\\nExamine a maxillary first and second molar as you read. \\nHold the roots up and the crowns down, with the two \\nsomewhat parallel buccal roots toward you.\\n1. RELATIVE CROWN SIZE AND SHAPE \\nFROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 5-15 for similarities and differences of \\nmaxillary molars from the buccal view.\\nMaxillary first molars have the largest occlusal out-\\nline of all maxillary teeth followed closely by the second \\nmolars in the same mouth. (Third molars are generally \\nthe smallest molar.)\\nThe crowns of both the first and second maxillary \\nmolars are broad mesiodistally , but the maxillary first \\nmolar is most often the widest tooth in the upper arch. \\nThe buccal crown height tapers shorter on the distal \\nthan on the mesial, which is most helpful in distin-\\nguishing rights from lefts. Since the occlusal surface \\nslants cervically from mesial to distal, some have sug-\\ngested that the crown appears to tip distally at its cer-\\nvix on its root trunk.\\n2. NUMBERS AND SIZE OF CUSPS \\nON MAXILLARY MOLARS \\n(AND ASSOCIATED GROOVE) \\nFROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nAs on mandibular molars, both first and second max-\\nillary molars  have four larger cusps (seen best on \\nan occlusal view in Fig. 5-16 ). The relative heights \\nof the four major cusps of maxillary molars are the \\nlongest mesiolingual, followed by the mesiobuccal, \\ndistobuccal, and the shortest distolingual (if present). \\nTherefore, from the buccal view , the two buccal cusps \\nare  prominently visible, but the mesiolingual cusp tip \\nmay be visible because it is longer (and even the short \\ndistolingual cusp might be seen because it, and the \\nmesiolingual cusp, are positioned slightly to the distal \\nof the buccal cusps).\\nOf the two buccal cusps, the mesiobuccal cusp is \\nnormally wider than the distobuccal cusp, but not \\nnecessarily sharper.\\nS A buccal groove lies between the \\nbuccal cusps and may extend onto the buccal surface \\nto the middle third of the crown, but this groove is \\nunlikely to be fissured and form decay on the buccal \\nsurface.\\n3. PROXIMAL CONTACTS OF MAXILLARY \\nMOLARS FROM THE BUCCAL VIEW \\n(SAME FOR ALL MOLARS)\\nFor most maxillary (and mandibular) first and second \\nmolars, the mesial contact is located near the junc-\\ntion of occlusal and middle thirds. The distal contact \\nis located more cervically in the middle third of the \\ncrown. A summary of the location of the proximal \\ncontacts of maxillary and mandibular molars is found \\nin Table 5-3 , and a review for all adult teeth (except \\nthirds) is presented in Table 5-4.\\n4. ROOTS OF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE BUCCAL VIEW\\nThere are three roots on a maxillary molar: the \\nmesiobuccal, the distobuccal, and the lingual. The \\nroot trunks are relatively long with the furcation (tri-\\nfurcation) often near the junction of the cervical and \\nmiddle thirds. The three roots are close to the same \\nlength,\\nT but the lingual (palatal) root is the lon-\\ngest, followed by the mesiobuccal root, and then the \\nTYPE TRAITS THAT DIFFERENTIATE MAXILLARY SECOND \\nMOLARS FROM MAXILLARY FIRST MOLARSSECTION III\\nOBJECTIVES\\nThis section prepares the reader to perform the \\nfollowing:\\n• Describe the type traits that can be used to \\ndistinguish the permanent maxillary first molar \\nfrom the maxillary second molar.\\n• Describe and identify the buccal, lingual, mesial, \\ndistal, and occlusal surfaces for all maxillary \\nmolars.\\n• Assign a Universal number to maxillary molars \\npresent in a mouth (or on a model) with \\ncomplete dentition.

TYPE TRAITS OF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 5-17 for similarities and differences.\\n1. RELATIVE SIZE AND TAPER OF MAXILLARY \\nMOLARS FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nLittle or no mesial or distal surfaces of maxillary first \\nmolar crowns are visible from the lingual view (except \\nin the cervical third) since these teeth may be as wide \\nor wider on the lingual half than on the buccal half \\ndue to a relatively wide distolingual cusp. This is an \\nEXCEPTION (along with the three-cusp mandibular \\nsecond premolar) to the normal taper toward the lingual \\nfor all other posterior teeth. Maxillary second molars\\nare narrower in the lingual half due to the relatively \\nsmaller or nonexistent distolingual cusp. The lingual \\nsurface of the crown on both types of maxillary molars \\nis narrower in the cervical third than in the middle \\nthird, since the crown tapers to join the single palatal \\nroot (seen clearly in the maxillary molars in Fig. 5-17).\\n2. NUMBERS AND DESCRIPTION \\nOF LINGUAL CUSPS ON A MAXILLARY \\nMOLAR FROM THE LINGUAL VIEW\\nOn the maxillary first molar , there are two well-\\ndefined cusps on the lingual surface, the larger \\nmesiolingual cusp and the smaller, but still sizeable, \\ndistolingual cusp. The mesiolingual cusp is almost \\nalways the largest and highest cusp on any maxillary \\nmolar (seen on most first molars in Fig. 5-17).\\nAdditionally , on over two thirds of maxillary first \\nmolars, a small fifth cusp of Carabelli  (or a groove or \\ndepression in the same area) is found on the lingual sur-\\nface of the mesiolingual cusp\\nU (Appendix 8i). This cusp \\nwas named after the Austrian dentist who described \\nit, Georg von Carabelli (1787–1842). This cusp varies \\ngreatly in shape but is considered to be a nonfunction-\\ning cusp because it is about 2 mm shorter than the mesi-\\nolingual cusp tip. Examples of a large cusp of Carabelli \\nand a groove in the same area are seen in Figure 5-18.\\nThere are two types of maxillary second molars\\nbased on the number of cusps (four or three). Slightly \\nless than two thirds of maxillary second molars have \\nfour cusps: two buccal and two lingual cusps—a mesi-\\nolingual cusp (which is considerably larger) and a \\nsmaller distolingual cusp. Over one third of maxillary \\nsecond molars have only three cusps called a tricuspid \\nform.\\nV On these teeth, the distolingual cusp is miss-\\ning, so it has just one large lingual cusp and two buccal \\ncusps. Normally , there is no cusp of Carabelli on maxil-\\nlary second molars.\\nOn both first and second maxillary molars with two\\nlingual cusps, there is a groove separating the mesiolin-\\ngual and distolingual cusps that extends onto the lin-\\ngual surface where it is called the lingual groove. This \\nlingual groove may be continuous with the longitudinal \\ndepression on the lingual surface of the  lingual root. On \\nthe three-cusp type of maxillary second molars , there \\nis no distolingual cusp, so there is no lingual groove. \\nSee if you can identify the maxillary second molars \\nwith only one lingual cusp in Figure 5-17.\\nTable 5-4 SUMMARY OF LOCATION OF PROXIMAL CONTACTS ON ALL TEETHa (PROXIMAL \\nHEIGHT OF CONTOUR; SEEN BEST FROM FACIAL VIEW) (Continued)\\nMESIAL SURFACE (WHICH THIRD OR JUNCTION?)

MAXILLARY MOLAR CUSPS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nLike the crowns of a mandibular molar, maxillary\\nfirst molar crowns appear short occlusocervically and \\nbroad faciolingually from the proximal view. Recall \\nthat the cusps of this first molar from longest to short-\\nest are mesiolingual, mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and \\ndistolingual, followed by the functionless cusp of \\nCarabelli. Therefore, from the distal view, the distobuc-\\ncal cusp and smallest distolingual cusp are prominent \\nin the foreground, while the cusp tips of the longer \\nmesiobuccal and longest mesiolingual cusp can be seen \\nbehind them. In contrast, only the longer mesial cusps \\nare visible from the mesial view. If present, a prominent \\ncusp of Carabelli can be seen on the lingual outline of \\nthe mesiolingual cusp (2–3 mm cervical to the mesio-\\nlingual cusp tip) from both the mesial and distal views \\n(Fig. 5-19 drawing).\\nFrom the mesial and distal views, the crown of the \\nmaxillary second molar looks much like that of the first \\nmolar, except that there is no fifth cusp (Fig. 5-19). \\nAlso, the distolingual cusp is absent on more than one \\nthird of these teeth.\\n2. HEIGHT OF CONTOUR \\nFOR MAXILLARY MOLARS FROM \\nTHE PROXIMAL VIEWS (SAME \\nFOR ALL POSTERIOR TEETH)\\nAs on all posterior teeth, the height of contour of the \\nbuccal surface of both first and second maxillary molar \\ncrowns is in the cervical third, usually close to the cer-\\nvical line. The height of contour of the lingual surface \\nof the crown is more occlusal, usually in or near the \\nmiddle third of the crown. However, the lingual crest of \\ncurvature may be located even more occlusally on teeth \\nwith a large cusp of Carabelli (Fig. 5-20).\\n3. TAPER TOWARD DISTAL OF MAXILLARY \\nMOLARS FROM THE DISTAL VIEW\\nFrom the distal view on both maxillary first and second \\nmolars, both the buccal surface and the lingual surface\\nof the crown can be seen because the crown tapers \\ntoward the distal, so the crown is narrower buccolin-\\ngually on the distal surface than on the mesial surface \\n(seen on most distal views in Fig. 5-19).\\n4. MARGINAL RIDGES \\nOF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nAs on mandibular molars, both first and second max-\\nillary molars have a concave distal marginal ridge that \\nis located more cervically than its mesial marginal \\nridge, permitting a better view of the occlusal sur-\\nface (including the triangular ridges) from the distal \\nview than from the mesial view . (Compare mesial and \\ndistal views in Fig. 5-19.) This marginal ridge height \\ndifference is very helpful in differentiating right from \\nleft sides.\\nIn general, marginal ridge grooves are found on over \\ntwo thirds of mesial marginal ridges but fewer than \\nhalf of distal marginal ridges\\nX and are more common \\non first molars than on seconds. Also, on the unworn \\nmarginal ridges of the maxillary molars, there may be \\none or more projections of enamel called tubercles.\\nLike marginal ridge grooves, they are more common \\non mesial marginal ridges than on the distal (and are \\nmore common on first molars than on seconds).\\nY These \\ntubercles are seen most clearly on the mesial marginal \\nridges of the maxillary first and second molars in \\nFigure 5-21.\\n5. CERVICAL LINES OF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nOn both types of maxillary molars, the mesial cervical \\nline has a slight occlusal curvature. Z There is less cur-\\nvature of the cervical line on the distal surface than on \\nthe mesial surface, but the difference is hardly discern-\\nible, since this cementoenamel junction is practically \\nflat buccolingually.\\nFIGURE 5-20. Maxillary right first molar, mesial view, with an \\nunusually large cusp of Carabelli and a lingual height of con-\\ntour positioned quite occlusally.

ROOTS OF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE PROXIMAL VIEWS\\nOn both the maxillary first and second molars from \\nthe mesial view , two roots can be seen: the lingual \\nroot and the mesiobuccal root, which is considerably \\nwider buccolingually than the hidden distobuccal root \\n(Appendix 8, mesial views). On the first maxillary \\nmolar, the convex buccal outline of the mesiobuccal\\nroot often extends a little buccal to the crown outline, \\nbut the apex of this root is in line with the tip of the \\nmesiobuccal cusp (Fig. 5-19).

To \\nfollow the description of traits from the occlusal view, \\nthe tooth should be held in such a position that the \\nobserver is looking exactly perpendicular to the plane \\nof the occlusal surface. Because of the spread of the first \\nmolar roots, some of each of the three roots (particu-\\nlarly the lingual root) may be visible when the tooth is \\nin this position (characteristic of many maxillary first\\nmolars in Fig. 5-22).\\n1. NUMBERS AND SIZE OF CUSPS \\nON MAXILLARY MOLARS FROM \\nTHE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nAs stated earlier in this chapter, most first maxillary \\nmolars usually have four relatively large cusps and \\nmany have the fifth cusp (cusp of Carabelli). Most \\nsecond molars  have three relatively large cusps and \\na noticeably smaller distolingual cusp (and no cusp \\nof Carabelli), while some second molars have only \\nthree cusps when the distolingual cusp is absent. The \\ndifference in size of the distolingual cusp of maxillary \\nsecond molars is evident in Figure 5-23.\\nUse Figure 5-24  when comparing the relative size \\nof major cusps for maxillary first and second molars. \\nThe relative cusp size on the four-cusp type of both\\nmaxillary first and second molars is the same order \\nas for the cusp heights : from largest to smallest, the \\nlargest mesiolingual, then mesiobuccal, distobuccal, \\nand the smallest distolingual.\\nAA On second molars ,\\nthere is usually a greater difference in the size of the \\nbuccal cusps, with the mesiobuccal noticeably larger \\n(Fig. 5-24), and the distolingual cusp either small-\\nest or not present. The triangular shape formed by \\nthe three cusps found on a three-cusp type max-\\nillary second molar (namely , the mesiolingual, \\nmesiobuccal, and distobuccal cusps) is collectively \\nknown as the maxillary molar primary cusp triangle\\n(Fig. 5-24).\\n2. OUTLINE OF FIRST MOLAR \\nFROM OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nMaxillary first molars are slightly larger buccolingually \\nthan mesiodistally (arch trait for the maxillary molars) \\nalthough the outline gives the general impression of \\nsquareness when compared to other teeth. Actually, \\nit is more like a parallelogram, with two more acute \\n(sharper) and two obtuse (blunter) angles (Appendix \\n8k). The acute angles are the mesiobuccal and dis-\\ntolingual. Also, on many maxillary first molars, the \\nmesiodistal dimension of the lingual half of the crown \\nis slightly wider mesiodistally than the buccal half due \\nto a relatively large distolingual cusp. In Figure 5-22, \\ntry to locate one or two maxillary first molars that are \\nnot wider on the lingual than on the buccal sides. They \\nare a minority.\\nThe maxillary second molar crowns are even wider \\nbuccolingually than mesiodistally. There is consider-\\nable variation in the morphology of these molars, par-\\nticularly in the size of the distolingual cusp. When the \\ndistolingual cusp is absent (about one third of the time), \\nthe tooth has only three cusps (Fig. 5-23C). Four max-\\nillary second molars in Figure 5-22 have no distolin-\\ngual cusps. The three-cusp type is somewhat triangular\\nor heart shaped, the blunt apex of the triangle being the \\nlingual cusp.\\nThe more common four-cusp type of maxillary \\nsecond molars is less square in appearance than the \\nfirst molar with a parallelogram shape that has a more \\nacute, sharper angle at the mesiobuccal corner due in \\npart to a prominent mesial (or mesiobuccal) cervical \\nridge (Fig. 5-24). This trait is helpful in differentiating \\nrights from lefts and is vividly apparent on all maxillary \\nsecond molars in Figure 5-22.'),\n",

Triangular ridges of \\nthe mesiobuccal and mesiolingual cusps join to form a \\ntransverse ridge. The largest mesiolingual cusp also has \\nanother ridge.

FOSSAE OF MAXILLARY MOLARS \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW\\nOn four-cusp type maxillary molars, there are four fos-\\nsae on the occlusal surface ( Fig. 5-27). Three of these, \\nthe mesial triangular, distal triangular and central fos-\\nsae, are similar in location to the mandibular molars. A \\nsmall mesial triangular fossa is just distal to the mesial \\nmarginal ridge. The smallest, distal triangular fossa ,\\nis just mesial to the distal marginal ridge. The largest \\ncentral fossa is near the center of the occlusal surface. \\nIn maxillary molars, this central fossa is bounded dis-\\ntally by the elevation of the oblique ridge, mesially by \\nthe mesial transverse ridge, and buccally by the buccal \\ncusp ridges. A fourth fossa, or cigar-shaped depression, \\nis the distal fossa that extends between the mesiolingual \\nand distolingual cusps.\\nOn three-cusp type maxillary (second) molars ,\\nwhen the distolingual cusp is missing, the distal (cigar-\\nshaped) fossa is also missing and there are only three \\nfossae remaining (one large central and two very small \\ntriangular fossae).\\n5. GROOVES ON MAXILLARY MOLARS\\nRefer to Figure 5-26 while studying these grooves. \\nOn the four-cusp type of maxillary molar , the promi-\\nnent oblique ridge plays an important role in defining \\nthe pattern of the developmental grooves. This type \\nof maxillary molar has five major grooves: the cen-\\ntral, buccal, distal oblique, lingual, and sometimes the \\ntransverse groove of the oblique ridge. Unlike the man-\\ndibular molar where the central groove extends from \\nthe mesial fossa to the distal fossa, the central groove\\non the maxillary molar extends from the mesial fossa \\nover the mesial transverse ridge and ends in the central \\nfossa. The buccal groove extends buccally from the cen-\\ntral fossa and may continue onto the buccal surface of \\nthe crown (Fig. 5-26).\\nDistal to the central groove is the prominent oblique \\nridge, which usually has no distinct groove crossing it, \\nbut when it does, the groove appears to be a continu-\\nation of the central groove and is called the transverse\\ngroove of the oblique ridge .

TYPE TRAITS OF ALL THIRD \\nMOLARS (DIFFERENT FROM FIRST \\nAND SECOND MOLARS)\\nMost often, there are four third molars in a mouth, \\none at the distal position in each quadrant. However, \\nnearly one fifth of the population may have one or \\nmore of their third molars congenitally missing (they \\nnever developed).\\nBB The mesial surfaces of third molars \\ncontact the distal surfaces of second molars, but the \\ndistal surfaces of third molars are not in proximal con-\\ntact with any other tooth. In ideal alignment of teeth \\nbetween arches, maxillary third molars bite against \\n(occlude with) only the mandibular third molars; all \\nother teeth EXCEPT mandibular central incisors have \\nthe potential for occluding with two teeth.\\nThird molars, also known to many as wisdom teeth, \\nhave gotten a bad reputation for not serving any func-\\ntion, having soft enamel, readily decaying, and causing \\ncrowding of the anterior teeth and other dental prob-\\nlems. The truth is that the posterior location of third \\nmolars in the mouth makes it more difficult to keep \\nthem clean, and their wrinkled, fissured occlusal sur-\\nfaces make them more prone to developing decay than \\nother teeth. Further, mandibular third molars often \\nerupt so far distally that there is not room to com-\\npletely erupt, which compromises the health of the \\nsurrounding tissue (gingiva), so dentists often suggest \\nthat these teeth be removed to prevent future problems. \\nInflammation of the tissue around these teeth (called \\npericoronitis) can be a cause of acute pain and spread \\nof infection, resulting in the need for gingival surgery \\nor extraction ( Fig. 5-30). This infection is even more \\nlikely to occur if the flap of tissue overlying the erupt-\\ning third molar, called an operculum, becomes irri-\\ntated. However, it is not true that third molars have soft \\nenamel, are useless, or should be routinely extracted. If \\nthe dental arches are of sufficient length to permit full \\neruption of third molars and a person’s oral hygiene is \\ngood, third molars can function for a lifetime without \\nproblems. Also, healthy third molars can serve as the \\nposterior attachment (abutment) when replacing lost \\nor missing first or second molars.\\nSome oral surgeons recommend that when third \\nmolars have to be extracted, they be removed at an \\nearly age (under 25 years old) to facilitate an easier, \\nless traumatic removal, and a quicker, more comfort-\\nable recovery period than if they were extracted later in \\nlife.\\n10 Since many third molars are extracted before the \\nroots are completely formed, you can easily look into \\nthe open ends of the root apices of these teeth and see \\nthe pulp tissue in the root canals.\\nMAXILLARY AND MANDIBULAR THIRD MOLAR TYPE TRAITSSECTION IV\\nOBJECTIVES\\nAfter studying this section, the reader should be able \\nto perform the following:\\n• List the type traits that are unique to all third \\nmolars that can be used to distinguish them from \\nfirst or second molars.\\n• From a selection of all types of molars, select the \\nmandibular and maxillary third molars and assign \\neach a Universal number.\\n• In mouths (or casts) of mandibular and maxillary \\narches with only one or two molars per quadrant, \\nidentify which molars are present and which are \\nabsent based on crown anatomy and position in the \\narch. (Remember that molars can change positions \\nin the arch if they drift forward after the extraction \\nof a first or second molar or are moved during orth-\\nodontic treatment, so arch position should not be \\nthe only way to confirm which molars are present.)\\nFIGURE 5-30. An operculum is a flap of tissue that may cover \\nthe crown of an erupting, most posterior mandibular molar \\n(especially when there is no room for it to erupt completely). This \\nflap is subject to irritation and infection surrounding the crown \\nknown as pericoronitis. (Courtesy of Carl Allen, D.D.S., M.S.D.)'),\n",

SIZE AND SHAPE OF THIRD MOLARS\\nBoth maxillary and mandibular third molars vary consid-\\nerably in size, but they are, on average, the shortest teeth \\nin the mouth. Mandibular thirds are the shortest of all \\nmandibular teethCC, and maxillary thirds are the short-\\nest of all permanent teeth. The roots of maxillary molars \\nare, on average, shorter than the roots of the firsts or sec-\\nond molars,\\nDD and their root trunks are proportionally \\nlonger than the root trunks of the firsts and seconds.EE\\nC. SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES OF \\nTHIRD MOLAR CROWNS COMPARED \\nWITH FIRST AND SECOND MOLARS \\nIN THE SAME ARCH\\nMaxillary third molars have the greatest morphologic \\nvariance of all teeth. The great amount of variation in \\nmaxillary third molars also makes a general description \\ndifficult. The crown may have only one cusp or as many \\nas eight,\\n11 but it also may resemble a small maxillary first \\nmolar (complete with cusp of Carabelli) or second molar \\n(without the cusp of Carabelli, and perhaps without the \\ndistolingual cusp). Sometimes the form of the maxillary \\nthird molar crown is so irregular that it is difficult to \\nidentify the mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and lingual cusps.\\nHowever, in many ways, maxillary third molars may \\nresemble maxillary second or first molars. For example,\\nthe usual relative cusp size from largest to smallest is \\nthe same as in the first and second molars: first, the \\nmesiolingual cusp is largest and longest; followed by \\nthe mesiobuccal cusp, which is wider and usually lon-\\nger than the distobuccal cusp; followed by the small-\\nest distolingual cusp (if present). The oblique ridge is \\npoorly developed and often absent (maxillary molars in \\nFig. 5-32). From the occlusal view, the maxillary third \\nmolar crown outline usually tapers from buccal to lin-\\ngual, being narrower on the lingual side, and tapers from \\nmesial to distal, being considerably larger faciolingually \\nin its mesial half due to a prominent mesiobuccal cervi-\\ncal ridge and large mesiolingual cusp (Fig. 5-32). Also, \\nthe buccal surface can be distinguished from the lingual \\nbecause the buccal surface is relatively more flat.\\nAlthough the crown of a mandibular third molar\\nmay exhibit great variance in size and shape and look \\nlike no other tooth (as seen in Fig. 5-34), its crown quite \\noften resembles that of the mandibular second molar \\n(with four cusps) or the crown of the mandibular first \\nmolar (with five cusps). For example, the occlusal out-\\nline of a mandibular third molar crown is rectangular \\nor oval and wider mesiodistally than buccolingually.\\nFF\\nThe crown of the four-cusp type tapers from mesial \\nto distal and from buccal to lingual (but only slightly) \\n(occlusal aspect).\\nEE As on mandibular first and second \\nmolars, the lingual cusps of mandibular third molars \\nare often larger and longer than the buccal cusps, with \\nFIGURE 5-33. Buccal views of maxillary and mandibular third molars. Notice the fused roots and long root trunks. The mesial \\nsurfaces all face toward the centerline.

CROWN AND ROOT DEVELOPMENT\\nWith these basic time periods in mind, one must \\nnot forget that much more is taking place during the \\ndevelopment of these teeth than just their eruption \\ninto the mouth, or their exfoliation. Prior to eruption, \\ntooth crowns are forming from lobes and are calcify-\\ning within the jawbones. After crown calcification is \\ncompleted, the tooth root starts to form and the tooth \\nmoves through bone toward the surface (eruption pro-\\ncess) and eventually through the oral mucosa into the \\noral cavity (eruption or emergence). After eruption, \\nthe root continues to form until root formation is com-\\npleted. At the same time, primary teeth are forming \\nand erupting, permanent teeth are already beginning to \\nform within the jaw bones. As these permanent teeth \\ndevelop and calcify, they eventually move occlusally to \\nreplace the primary teeth.\\nNow let us look at this entire process in more detail, \\ndiscussing it step by step. All of the following informa-\\ntion is derived from Table 6-1A.\\n1. CROWN CALCIFICATION \\nOF PRIMARY TEETH\\nThe crowns of all 20 primary teeth begin to calcify \\nbetween 4 and 6 months in utero (seen developing in \\nFig. 6-4). Crown completion of all primary teeth occurs \\nwithin the first year after birth, taking an average of \\n10 months from the beginning of tooth calcification.\\nB\\n2. ROOT FORMATION AND EMERGENCE \\nOF PRIMARY TEETH\\nRoot formation for primary (and permanent) teeth \\nbegins once the enamel on the crown is formed, and \\nat this time, the tooth starts its occlusal movement \\nthrough bone toward the oral cavity. After the primary \\ntooth crowns erupt into the oral cavity from about age \\n6 months to 2 years (24 months),\\nC they continue to erupt \\nuntil eventually they occlude with teeth in the opposite \\narch. These teeth also continue to erupt to compensate \\nfor wear (attrition) on the incisal or occlusal surface \\nand/or when there are no opposing teeth.\\n3. ORDER OF EMERGENCE OF PRIMARY \\nTEETH (FROM 6 MONTHS TO ABOUT \\n2 YEARS OLD)\\nAccording to one study (shown in Table 6-2), the first\\nprimary teeth to erupt are the mandibular central inci-\\nsors, at about 6 months of age, followed by the mandib-\\nular laterals and then the maxillary incisors (centrals \\nbefore laterals). (Note the difference in eruption pat-\\nterns compiled by other researchers in Table 6-1B, where \\nthe mandibular central incisors erupt first, but they are \\nfollowed by maxillary central incisors, maxillary lateral \\nincisors, and finally mandibular lateral incisors.) Next \\nto emerge are the primary first molars, then canines, \\nFIGURE 6-4. Developing human primary molars. A.\\nOcclusal view of an in utero 19-week maxillary right first molar. \\nNote the large, well-developed, mesiobuccal cusp, which is cov-\\nered with a mineralized enamel cap and is the first formed and \\nlargest cusp of the trigon, the early molar form that has three \\ncusps.

Thus, the last primary teeth \\nto emerge, thereby completing the primary denti-\\ntion, are the maxillary second molars, at about 2 years \\n(24 months) of age.\\nThe combined mesiodistal arch space occupied by \\nthe primary canines and molars in each quadrant is \\ngreater than that occupied by the permanent canines \\nand premolars since the primary molars are wider \\nthan the premolars that will replace them. This dif-\\nference in space is called the leeway space . Also, as \\nprimary teeth erupt, developmental spaces often \\noccur between anterior teeth, especially as the maxil-\\nlae and the mandible bones grow larger. These spaces \\nthat occur mesial to the maxillary canines and distal \\nto the mandibular canines are called primate spaces .\\n2\\nThese spaces frequently concern parents but are per-\\nfectly natural and even beneficial since they provide \\nroom for the secondary incisors and canines, which \\nare considerably wider than their predecessors. Refer \\nto T able 6-3 for differences in sizes between primary \\nand permanent teeth.\\n4. ROOT COMPLETION OF PRIMARY TEETH\\nPrimary tooth roots are completed between the ages of \\n18 months to 3 years.\\nD The complete primary dentition \\n(with 20 teeth) is in the mouth from about 2 years of \\nage to about 6 years, during which no permanent teeth\\nare visible in the mouth, but permanent teeth are form-\\ning within the jaws.\\n5. EXFOLIATION (SHEDDING) \\nOF PRIMARY TEETH WITH THE NEARLY \\nSIMULTANEOUS ERUPTION \\nOF THE PERMANENT TEETH\\nThe roots of primary teeth are complete for only a \\nshort period of time (as seen in Fig. 6-5). Only about \\n3 years after completion, primary tooth roots begin \\nto resorb, usually at the apex or on one side near the \\napex. Resorption of a primary tooth root is the grad-\\nual dissolving away of the root due to the underlying \\neruption of the succedaneous tooth that will replace it. \\nRoot resorption continues as succedaneous teeth move \\ncloser to the surface until deciduous teeth eventually \\nbecome loose and finally “fall off” (like leaves fall off \\nof deciduous trees). This process of shedding is called \\nexfoliation. When a primary tooth is shed, the crown \\nof the succedaneous tooth is close to the surface and \\nready to emerge (as seen in Fig. 6-6).\\n6. MIXED DENTITION (FROM ABOUT \\n6 TO 12 YEARS OLD)\\nWhen there are both primary and permanent teeth vis-\\nible in the mouth, the dentition is known as a mixed\\ndentition. Mixed dentition begins at about age 6 years \\nold when the first (6-year) molars emerge. Next, the \\nfirst primary incisors are gradually replaced by their \\nlarger successors. The mixed dentition ends at about \\nage 12 when all primary teeth have been replaced. \\nUsually , 24 teeth are seen in the mouth throughout \\nthe mixed dentition (20 teeth [primary or their perma-\\nnent successors], plus the four 6-year first molars). At \\n12 years old, all succedaneous teeth have replaced their \\nprimary predecessors marking the end of mixed denti-\\ntion. When the 12-year second molars erupt, 28 teeth \\nare present. The full complement of 32 permanent teeth \\nis not reached until the third molars erupt during the \\nlate teenage years or early 20s.\\nSoon after the 6-year first molars erupt, their erup-\\ntive forces, along with their tendency to drift toward \\nthe mesial, push the primary teeth forward. If this were \\nto continue, there would be insufficient space for the \\npremolars to come in. The flared roots of the primary \\nmolars, however, resist the mesial displacement (seen \\nin Fig. 6-5). This primary molar root flare, primary \\nmolar crown size wider mesiodistally than their pre-\\nmolar successors, and primate spaces all help to pre-\\nserve sufficient space for the premolars and secondary \\ncanines.\\n3\\n7.

ORDER OF EMERGENCE \\nFOR SECONDARY TEETH\\nTable 6-4  shows the sequence of eruption for perma-\\nnent teeth. After the 6-year molars erupt just prior to \\nthe child’s sixth birthday, the order of eruption for \\nthe succedaneous teeth is essentially the same as the \\norder of exfoliation of the primary teeth they replace. \\nIf you know the time range for eruption of incisors \\n(between 6 and 9 years old), or for canines and premo-\\nlars (between 9 and 12 years old), plus the sequence of \\neruption within that time range, you can estimate the \\neruption time for any succedaneous tooth. Remember \\nthat centrals erupt before laterals, and mandibular inci-\\nsors erupt before their maxillary counterpart. The first\\npermanent incisors to erupt are the mandibular central \\nincisors (close to 6 years old) and the last incisors to \\nerupt are the maxillary lateral incisors (close to 9 years \\nold). Mandibular laterals and maxillary centrals erupt \\nfrom 7 to 8 years old.\\nNext, adult canines and premolars erupt between ages 9 \\nand 12. If you know the eruption sequence within this \\nrange, you can estimate the eruption time. First, mandib-\\nular canines replace primary mandibular canines (closer \\nto 9 years old), and then premolars replace primary \\nmolars (between 10 and 12 years old). Finally , maxillary \\ncanines are the last primary teeth to be replaced  (closer \\nto 12 years old). This is often evident when the per-\\nmanent maxillary canines are crowded facially as they \\nerupt (as seen in Fig. 6-3). Note in Table 6-4 that for \\nthe adult dentition, most teeth in the mandibular arch \\nerupt slightly earlier than their maxillary counterparts; \\nthe ONLY maxillary tooth to emerge before its mandibu-\\nlar counterpart is the maxillary second premolar, which \\nprecedes the mandibular second premolar. Knowing the \\nrange and sequence of eruption of canines and premo-\\nlars, you can estimate the emergence time of mandibu-\\nlar canines as close to 9 years, while maxillary canines \\nemerge last within this range, at about 12 years of age.\\nRoots of secondary teeth are completed about 3 years\\nafter their emergence into the oral cavity.\\nFIGURE 6-5. Models depicting the stage \\nof development of the dentitions of a 3-year-old \\nchild. All primary teeth have emerged into the oral \\ncavity, and they have full roots, prior to resorp-\\ntion.

TRAITS OF ALL PRIMARY \\nTEETH COMPARED \\nTO PERMANENT TEETH\\nFirst, consider the traits that apply to all primary teeth \\nand set them apart from the secondary teeth:\\n1. Primary teeth are smaller in size than the permanent \\nteeth with the same name (that is, primary incisors \\nand canines are smaller than permanent incisors and \\ncanines, respectively, and primary first and second \\nmolars are smaller than permanent first and sec-\\nond molars, respectively).\\n2. The crowns and roots of primary teeth have a marked \\nconstriction at the cervix, appearing as if they are \\nbeing squeezed in around the CEJ. Thus, primary \\ntooth crowns (especially on the facial and lingual \\nsurfaces) bulge close to the cervical line forming \\nmore prominent labial cervical ridges and lingual \\ncingula\\n4 rather than on permanent teeth. This is \\nseen best from the proximal view in Appendices 9a \\nand 10e.\\n3. Primary teeth have relatively longer roots than their \\ncrowns compared to permanent teeth.\\n4. Primary teeth are less mineralized so become very \\nworn.\\n4,5 These teeth are prone to considerable attri-\\ntion [at TRISH en] (tooth wear from tooth-to-tooth \\ncontact), which is made worse by the shifting rela-\\ntionship of the upper and lower teeth due to expand-\\ning growth of the jaws in young children. Attrition, \\ntherefore, is not really a dentition trait but a normal \\noccurrence due to function.\\n4\\n5. The layers of enamel and dentin of primary teeth are \\nthinner than on secondary teeth, so the pulp cavi-\\nties are proportionally larger and therefore closer \\nto the surface (seen in the radiographs in Fig. 6-7).\\nTherefore, decay can progress to the pulp more \\nFIGURE 6-7. Radiographs made of an 8-year-old \\nchild showing the first and second primary molars and \\nfirst adult molars in the mouth. The top radiograph \\nshows maxillary teeth, and the lower radiograph shows \\nmandibular teeth. Notice the premolar crowns between \\nthe partially resorbed roots of the maxillary and \\n mandibular primary molars. Part of the 12-year second \\nmolar crown is seen on the far right of each radio-\\ngraph. The smaller size, thinner enamel, and relatively \\nlarger pulp cavities are evident in the primary molars \\ncompared to the larger secondary molars just distal to \\nthem.

Primary teeth are whiter in color.\\n7. Primary teeth have more consistent shapes than the \\npermanent teeth (have fewer anomalies).\\n3\\nB. TRAITS OF ALL PRIMARY ANTERIOR\\nTOOTH CROWNS\\nConsider the unique traits of the primary anterior tooth \\ncrowns. Refer to Appendix page 9 while studying these \\ntraits.\\n1. Prominent cervical ridges on facial surfaces run mesi-\\nodistally in the cervical third (Appendix 9a, facial \\nsurfaces).\\n2. The prominent lingual cingula  seem to bulge and \\noccupy about one third of the cervicoincisal length \\n(Appendix 9a, lingual surfaces).\\n3. Usually, there are no depressions, mamelons, or per-\\nikymata on the labial surface of the crowns of the \\nprimary incisors. These surfaces are smoother  than \\non their successors.\\nC. ROOT TRAITS OF PRIMARY \\nANTERIOR TEETH\\n1. The roots of primary anterior teeth are long in pro-\\nportion to crown length (Appendix 9f) and are rela-\\ntively narrow mesiodistally (Appendix 9b).\\n2. The roots of primary anterior teeth bend labially in \\ntheir apical one third to one half by as much as 10° \\n(Appendix 9c).\\nD. TRAITS OF ALL PRIMARY POSTERIOR\\nTOOTH CROWNS\\nNow consider the unique traits of the primary poste-\\nrior tooth crowns. Refer to Appendix page 10 while \\nstudying these traits.\\n1. The prominent mesial cervical ridge  or bulge on the \\nbuccal surface is exaggerated by the curve of the cer-\\nvical line apically (best seen when viewed from the \\nbuccal) and by the constriction near the cervical line \\n(best viewed from the proximal, Appendix 10e). This \\nmesial cervical bulge makes it easy to distinguish\\nrights from lefts.\\n2. Due to the taper of the crown from the cervical \\nbulges toward the occlusal surface, the molar crowns \\nhave a narrow occlusal table (Appendix 10c). (Recall, \\nthe occlusal table is the chewing surface inside the \\nline formed by the continuous mesial and distal cusp \\nridges for all cusps, and the mesial and distal mar-\\nginal ridges).\\n3. As on permanent molars from the buccal view , all \\nmolar crowns are wide mesiodistally relative to their \\nheight cervico-occlusally (Appendix 10a).\\n4. The primary molar occlusal anatomy is shallow . In \\nother words, the cusps are short (not pointed or \\nsharp, almost flat) (Appendix 10d), occlusal ridges \\nare not pronounced, and fossae and sulci are corre-\\nspondingly not as deep as on secondary molars.\\n5. There are few grooves or depressions in the crowns.\\n6. In the primary dentition, primary second molars \\nare decidedly larger than primary first molars. This \\nis different in the permanent dentition where first \\nmolars are larger than seconds (Appendix page 10, \\ncompare firsts to seconds).\\n7. Microscopically, the enamel rods at the cervix slope \\nocclusally, unlike in permanent teeth where these \\nrods slope cervically.\\nE. ROOT TRAITS OF PRIMARY \\nPOSTERIOR TEETH\\n1. The root furcations are near the crown, with little or \\nno root trunk (Appendix 10f).\\n2. The roots are thin and slender and spread out  beyond \\nthe outlines of the crown, more widely on primary \\nsecond molars than the first molars (the opposite of \\nthe adult molars)\\n7 (Appendix 10g). This root diver-\\ngence makes room for the developing succedaneous \\npremolars. Extraction of a primary molar when \\nroots are complete and before they have started \\nto resorb may cause the developing portion of the \\npremolar to be removed along with the primary \\nmolar.\\n6\\n3. The roots of primary molars are similar to those of \\npermanent molars in relative size (before resorp-\\ntion) and number. Primary maxillary molars have \\nthree roots: the palatal (longest), mesiobuccal, and \\ndistobuccal (shortest). Primary mandibular molars \\nhave two roots: the mesial (largest) and distal.'),\n",

PRIMARY INCISOR TRAITS\\n1. PRIMARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\na. Outline Shape of Primary Incisor Crowns \\nfrom the Labial View\\nThe crowns of primary maxillary central incisors are \\nthe ONLY incisor crowns (primary or secondary) that \\nare wider mesiodistally than they are long incisocervi-\\ncally (Appendix 9e). As on permanent maxillary cen-\\ntral incisor crowns, the distoincisal angle of the incisal \\nedge of the primary maxillary central incisor  is more \\nrounded than the mesioincisal angle, but the incisal \\nedge is relatively straight.\\nThe maxillary lateral incisor  crowns are similar \\nin shape to the central incisor, but are longer inciso-\\ncervically than wide mesiodistally, and are less sym-\\nmetrical. Distoincisal angles of lateral incisors are even \\nmore rounded. Note this difference between the shapes \\nof primary maxillary incisors in Figures 6-8  and 6-9.\\nMaxillary laterals are smaller than central incisors in \\nthe same dentition.\\nThe crowns of the mandibular incisors  resemble \\ntheir replacement incisor crowns but are much smaller. \\nAs with permanent mandibular incisors, primary man-\\ndibular lateral incisor crowns are a little larger than the \\ncrowns of central incisors and less symmetrical (with \\nmore rounded distoincisal angles) than the central inci-\\nsors of the same dentition (Fig. 6-8).\\nThe relative locations of proximal contact areas on pri-\\nmary incisors are comparable to those of their successors.\\nb. Surface Morphology of Primary Incisors \\nfrom the Labial View\\nLabial surfaces of maxillary central incisors are smooth; \\nusually , there are no depressions. Mandibular incisors\\nare also relatively smooth (but may have very shallow \\ndepressions on their labial surfaces in the incisal third).\\nc. Root-to-Crown Proportion of Primary \\nIncisors from the Labial View\\nPrior to root resorption, all primary incisor roots are \\nmuch longer relative to the crown length than on sec-\\nondary incisors (Appendix 9f). Primary incisor roots \\nare about twice the length of the crown. The roots of \\nmaxillary lateral incisors appear proportionally even \\nlonger. On primary extracted or shed teeth, there is \\nusually some root resorption (evident in Fig. 6-9B ).\\nOften the entire root is gone.\\n2. PRIMARY INCISORS FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nRefer to Figure 6-10.\\na. Cingula of Primary Incisors \\nfrom the Lingual View\\nThe cingula of primary maxillary central incisors are \\noften proportionally large, so that prominent lingual \\nfossae are limited to only the incisal and middle thirds \\nof the lingual surface.

Cervical Line of Primary Incisors \\nfrom the Proximal Views\\nAs on permanent incisors, the curve of the cervical line \\ntoward the incisal is greater on the mesial than on the \\ndistal.

PRIMARY CANINE TRAITS\\n1. PRIMARY CANINES FROM \\nTHE LABIAL VIEW\\na. Outline Shape of Primary Canines \\nfrom the Labial View\\nMaxillary canine  crowns may be as wide as they are \\nlong. They are constricted at the cervix. They have \\nconvex mesial and distal outlines, with distal contours \\nmore rounded than mesial contours, which are some-\\nwhat angular ( Fig. 6-13). Mandibular canine crowns, \\nlike permanent canines, are longer incisocervically than \\nwide mesiodistally and are narrower mesiodistally than \\nmaxillary canine crowns (Appendix 9g).\\nG\\nCusp Ridge Outlines of Primary Canines \\nfrom the Labial View:\\nMaxillary canine cusps are often very sharp (pointed) \\nmeeting at an acute angle. The cusp ridges of these \\nmaxillary canines are UNIQUE in that the mesial cusp \\nridge is longer  than the distal cusp ridges (similar to \\nonly the permanent maxillary first premolars, but just \\nthe opposite of all other premolars and canines, per-\\nmanent and primary) (Appendix 9h, maxillary canine, \\nand Fig. 6-13B). The mesial cusp ridges are less steeply \\ninclined\\n8 than the shorter distal ridges. Mandibular\\ncanines have sharp cusp tips pointed like an arrow \\n(Fig. 6-13A). As on permanent mandibular canines, the \\nmesial cusp slope is shorter than the distal cusp slope \\n(Appendix 9h, mandibular canine).\\nContact Areas of Primary Canines from \\nthe Labial View:\\nDistal contact areas of primary canines rest against the \\nmesial surfaces of primary first molars since there are \\nno primary premolars. Mesial and distal contact areas \\nof primary maxillary canines are near the center of the \\ncrown cervicoincisally, with the mesial contact more \\ncervically located than the distal contact, a condition \\nUNIQUE to this tooth and the permanent mandibular \\nfirst premolar (Appendix 9i).\\nb. Cervical Lines of Primary Canines \\nfrom the Labial View\\nCervical lines on maxillary canines are nearly straight \\non the labial surface.\\nc. Roots of Primary Canines \\nfrom the Labial View\\nMaxillary canine  roots prior to resorption are the \\nlongest of the primary teeth tapering to a blunt apex. \\nThe roots of mandibular canines are more tapered and \\npointed, and shorter than maxillary canine roots.\\nH\\n2. PRIMARY CANINES FROM \\nTHE LINGUAL VIEW\\nThe cingulum on a maxillary canine crown is bulky, \\nand the mesial and distal marginal ridges are well devel-\\noped but not as prominent as on permanent canines \\n(Fig. 6-10). The maxillary canine crown has a lingual \\nridge that divides a mesial fossa from the distal fossa. \\nDistal fossae on these teeth are narrower and deeper \\nthan mesial fossae, which are broader and shallower.\\n7,8\\nIn contrast, lingual ridges are barely discernible on \\nmandibular canines , with faint marginal ridges and \\nusually a single concavity or fossa (Fig. 6-10).\\n6\\n3. PRIMARY CANINES FROM THE PROXIMAL \\n(MESIAL AND DISTAL) VIEWS\\na.

Cervical Lines of Primary Canines from the \\nProximal Views\\nCervical lines of both maxillary and mandibular canines \\ncurve incisally more on the mesial side than on the dis-\\ntal side, just like all other anterior teeth.

PRIMARY CANINES FROM \\nTHE INCISAL VIEW\\na. Crown Outline of Primary Canines from the \\nIncisal View\\nThe crown outline of maxillary canines tapers notice-\\nably toward the cingulum, which is centered mesi-\\nodistally. The distal half of the crown is thinner \\nfaciolingually than the mesial half (similar to secondary \\nmaxillary canines). From the incisal aspect, mandibu-\\nlar canine crowns have a diamond shape and are nearly \\nsymmetrical, except for the mesial position of the \\ncusp tips, and a slightly bulkier distal half (Fig. 6-12). \\nCingula are centered or just distal to the center.\\nb. Crown Proportions and Size of Primary \\nCanines from the Incisal View\\nPrimary maxillary canine crowns are broader faciolin-\\ngually than incisor crowns and are considerably wider \\nmesiodistally than faciolingually .\\nI The 1.5-mm thick \\nmesial and distal cusp ridges curve toward the lingual at \\nboth ends. Mandibular canine crowns are only slightly \\nwider mesiodistally than faciolingually .\\nI The smallness \\nof these teeth compared to the permanent canines is \\nquite noticeable.\\nC. PRIMARY MOLAR TRAITS\\nAs stated earlier, primary molar roots are thin and \\nwidely spread to make room for the developing premo-\\nlar crowns that are forming beneath them ( Fig. 6-14).\\nRecall that primary first molars  are located over the \\ncrowns of developing first premolars and erupt just  distal\\nto primary canines and just mesial to primary second \\nmolars. Primary second molars  form over the crowns \\nof developing second premolars, just distal to primary \\nfirst molars and, after age 6, just mesial to 6-year first \\nmolars. It could be said that these primary molars are \\nsaving a place in the arch for the teeth that will suc-\\nceed them, namely, the first and second premolars, \\nrespectively. Both maxillary and mandibular primary \\nsecond molars are considerably wider than the second \\npremolars that will replace them.\\nJK\\nWhen distinguishing maxillary from mandibular \\nprimary molars, consider arch traits such as the num-\\nber of roots. Primary maxillary molars normally have \\nthree roots (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal, \\nas on permanent maxillary molars), whereas primary \\nmandibular molars have only two roots (mesial and \\ndistal, as on permanent mandibular molars). Also, like \\npermanent molars, maxillary primary molars tend to be \\nwider buccolingually than mesiodistally , whereas man-\\ndibular molars tend to be wider mesiodistally than buc-\\ncolingually . Compare the occlusal outlines of primary \\nmolars in the Appendix on page 10.\\nEach type of primary molar will be discussed in \\ndetail at this time, emphasizing the traits that further \\ndifferentiate each type. Discussion begins with primary \\nsecond molars since they are so similar to the perma-\\nnent first molars discussed previously in Chapter 5.\\n1. TYPE TRAITS OF PRIMARY \\nSECOND MOLARS\\nBoth maxillary and mandibular primary second molars\\nresemble the permanent first molars that erupt just dis-\\ntal to them, with cusp ridges and fossae corresponding \\nto those of permanent first molars. Maxillary primary \\nsecond molars may even have a cusp of Carabelli \\n(Fig. 6-15B and C).\\nFIGURE 6-14. All eight primary molars, buccal views.

LM The differences in \\nsize and position between primary maxillary second \\nmolars and permanent maxillary first molars are evi-\\ndent in Figures 6-16 and 6-17.\\nAnother obvious difference between a primary and \\npermanent molar crown is that primary molars have \\na much more prominent mesiobuccal cervical ridge\\nand constricted crown cervix  compared to permanent \\nmolars. Due to the prominent mesiobuccal cervical \\nridge and considerable taper toward the occlusal, \\nboth maxillary and mandibular primary second \\nmolars have small occlusal tables (best viewed from \\nthe proximal in Fig. 6-18  and Appendix 10c and e).\\n5\\nThe cervical lines are almost flat on both the mesial \\nand distal sides of the tooth, but slope cervically \\ntoward the facial due to the prominent mesial cer-\\nvical ridge. When viewed occlusally, this prominent \\nridge also accentuates the considerable taper narrow-\\ning from mesial to distal (seen in the Appendix page \\n10, occlusal view).\\na. Unique traits of Primary Mandibular \\nSecond Molars\\nAs on permanent mandibular first molars, primary \\nmandibular second molars have five cusps: three buc-\\ncal (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and distal) separated by \\nmesiobuccal and distobuccal grooves. However, the three \\nbuccal cusps of the primary mandibular second molars are \\nof nearly equal size (Appendix 10j) with the middle buccal \\ncusp (called the distobuccal) slightly larger. The two lin-\\ngual cusps (mesiolingual and distolingual) are separated \\nby a lingual groove. These lingual cusps are about the same \\nsize and height but slightly shorter than the buccal cusps.\\n7\\nFrom the proximal views, the mesial marginal ridge of a \\nprimary mandibular second molar is high and is crossed \\nby a groove that may extend about one third of the way \\ndown the mesial surface.\\n9 The contact area with the pri-\\nmary first molar is located just below the notch of the mar-\\nginal ridge.\\n9 Since the crown is shorter on the distal side \\nand the distal marginal ridge is lower (more cervical) than \\nthe mesial marginal ridge, all five cusps may be seen from \\nthe distal aspect. The distal contact with the mesial side of \\nthe 6-year first molar is located just buccal and cervical to \\nthe distal marginal groove (furrow) (Fig. 6-19B).\\n9\\nMandibular second molar roots are about twice as \\nlong as the crowns and are thin mesiodistally. The \\nmesial root is broad and flat with a blunt apex and has \\na shallow longitudinal depression. The distal root is \\nbroad and flat but is narrower and less blunt at the apex \\nthan the mesial root.\\nb. Unique Traits on Primary Maxillary \\nSecond Molars\\nAs on permanent maxillary first molars, primary max-\\nillary second molar have four major cusps and some-\\ntimes a cusp of Carabelli. The distolingual cusp is the \\nsmallest (unless there is a cusp of Carabelli), but the \\nmesiobuccal cusp may be almost equal in size to the \\nmesiolingual cusp, or even slightly larger (Appendix \\n10i) compared to the permanent maxillary first molar \\nwhere the mesiolingual cusp is largest. Also, from the \\nocclusal view, crowns of primary maxillary second \\nmolars taper narrower toward the lingual, especially \\ndue to the pronounced taper of the mesial surface, \\nwhich displaces the mesiolingual cusp more distally \\nthan on the permanent first molars (Appendix 10h). \\nThis also results in an oblique ridge that is straighter in \\nits course buccolingually\\n7 and a smaller, oblong distal \\nfossa buccolingually (Fig. 6-15C).\\nFIGURE 6-17.

Subsequently , the mesiobuccal angle is \\nacute. This taper is similar to that on the mesiolingual \\ntaper in the primary maxillary second molar (Appendix \\n10n). The distal surface does not taper.\\n3 Primary first \\nmolars are also much wider buccolingually in their \\nmesial half because of the very prominent mesial buc-\\ncal cervical ridge. From the mesial view , this prominent \\nridge causes the cervical line to slope apically toward \\nthe facial (Fig. 6-20B).\\nUnique traits that differentiate primary maxillary \\nand mandibular first molars are presented next.\\na. Unique Traits of Primary Maxillary \\nFirst Molars\\nPrimary maxillary first molar crowns are quite unique \\nin appearance ( Fig. 6-22 ). According to one author, \\nthey do not resemble any other molars. 10 According \\nto another author, from the occlusal view, they \\nresemble maxillary first premolars  that replace them \\n(Fig. 6-22C).\\n9\\nCusp size and shape on primary maxillary first \\nmolars: Primary maxillary first molars usually have \\nfour cusps, but they appear similar to maxillary premo-\\nlars from the occlusal view since they have only two\\nprominent cusps , a wide mesiobuccal cusp and a nar-\\nrower, slightly more distinct, mesiolingual cusp. The \\nmesiobuccal cusp is the longest (but second sharpest) \\ncusp.\\n7 The mesiolingual cusp is the second longest, but \\nsharpest, cusp. The other two cusps, the distobuccal \\nand distolingual, are relatively small and indistinct and \\nmay blend into the distal marginal ridge. Sometimes, \\nas in permanent maxillary second molars, the distolin-\\ngual cusp is absent (three-cusp type), but when it is \\npresent (four-cusp type), it is inconspicuous and may \\nappear as a small nodule on the lingual half of the dis-\\ntal marginal ridge.\\nOcclusal outline of primary maxillary first molars :\\nAs on all maxillary molars, primary and permanent \\n(and on premolars), the occlusal outline is wider faci-\\nolingually than mesiodistally .\\nQ Although the mesial \\nsurface tapers obliquely toward the lingual, the distal \\nsurface and marginal ridge run in a straight direction \\nbuccolingually , joining both the buccal and lingual \\nborders at right angles\\n6 (best seen in Fig. 6-22, occlusal \\nview).\\nFossae, ridges, and grooves on primary maxillary \\nfirst molars: There are three fossae on these primary \\nmaxillary first molars: a large and deep mesial triangu-\\nlar fossa, a medium-sized central fossa, and a minute \\ndistal triangular fossa, each with a pit: central, mesial, \\nand distal, respectively (Appendix 10o). The occlusal \\ngrooves of the four-cusp type primary maxillary first \\nmolars usually form an “H” pattern (seen in Fig. 6-22). \\nThe crossbar of the “H” is the central groove that con-\\nnects the central and mesial triangular fossae. (Some \\ntextbooks say there is no central groove and that the \\ncrossbar is made up of a mesial and distal groove \\ninstead.\\n9) Grooves running buccolingually just inside \\nof the mesial marginal ridge form the mesial side of the \\nFIGURE 6-22.

A groove between \\nthe two lingual cusps is present only when the distolin-\\ngual cusp is definite.\\nRoots of primary maxillary first molars : The three \\nroots (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal) of the \\nprimary maxillary first molar are thin and slender and \\nwidely spread apart, with the root furcation very close \\nto the cervical line, so there is very little root trunk \\n(Appendix 10f).\\nb. Unique Traits of Primary Mandibular \\nFirst Molars\\nPrimary mandibular first molars do not resemble any \\nother primary or secondary tooth (Fig. 6-21, teeth L and \\nS, and Fig. 6-20). According to one author, the chief \\ndifferentiating characteristic may be an overdeveloped\\nmesial marginal ridge (Appendix 10q).\\n9\\nCusp size and shape on primary mandibular first \\nmolars: The primary mandibular first molar has four \\ncusps. The cusps are often difficult to distinguish, but \\ncareful examination of an unworn tooth will reveal (in \\norder of diminishing size) a mesiobuccal, mesiolingual, \\ndistobuccal, and the smallest (also shortest) distolin-\\ngual cusp. The mesiobuccal cusp of the mandibular first \\nmolar is always the largest and longest cusp, occupying \\nnearly two thirds of the buccal surface (Appendix 10t; \\nFig. 6-20A). This cusp is characteristically compressed \\nbuccolingually , and its two long cusp ridges extend \\nmesially and distally , serving as a blade when occluding \\nwith the maxillary canine.\\n7 The mesiolingual cusp is \\nlarger, longer, and sharper than the distolingual cusp.\\nRidges, grooves, and fossae of primary  mandibular\\nfirst molars: The mesial marginal ridge is so well devel-\\noped that it resembles a cusp. 3 This longer, prominent \\nmesial marginal ridge is positioned more occlusally \\nthan the short, less prominent distal marginal ridge. \\n(Compare mesial and distal views in Fig. 6-18 for mar-\\nginal ridge heights and lengths.) There is also a promi-\\nnent transverse ridge  between the mesiobuccal and \\nmesiolingual cusps (Appendix 10u and Fig. 6-21, teeth \\nL and S).\\nA central groove separates the mesiobuccal and \\nmesiolingual cusps and connects with a shallow mesial \\nmarginal ridge groove. A short buccal depression (not \\nreally a distinct groove) separates the larger mesiobuc-\\ncal cusp from the smaller distobuccal cusp but does not \\nextend onto the buccal surface. There is also a slight \\ngroove between these two lingual cusps that becomes a \\nshallow depression on the lingual surface ending near \\nthe cervix. Both marginal ridges have shallow grooves \\nbetween them and cusp ridges of lingual cusps\\n8 similar \\nto the grooves in the triangular fossae of other poste-\\nrior teeth.\\nSince the distal half of the occlusal table is wider \\nthan the mesial half, the distal fossa is larger, extend-\\ning almost into the center of the occlusal surfaces \\n(Appendix 10v). It has a central pit and a small distal \\npit near the distal marginal ridge. The small mesial tri-\\nangular fossa has a mesial pit. There is no central fossa \\n(Fig. 6-20).\\nProximal view contours and contacts : From the \\nproximal views, the buccal crown contour is nearly \\n(but not quite) flat from the buccal crest of curvature \\nto the occlusal surface and cervico-occlusally . The lin-\\ngual surface is more convex cervico-occlusally . There is \\na slight curve of the mesial cervical line. On the distal \\nor lingual surface, the cervical line is practically flat or \\nhorizontal.\\nOcclusal outline of primary mandibular first \\nmolars: From the occlusal view , the entire occlusal out-\\nline is somewhat oval or rectangular and wider mesi-\\nodistally than faciolingually as seen in Figs. 6-20 and \\n6-21C. Also, the occlusal table  is wider mesiodistally \\nthan faciolingually (Appendix 10r).\\n9 The entire tooth\\noutline from the occlusal view appears to be wider \\nfaciolingually in the mesial half due to the prominent \\nmesial cervical ridge, but the occlusal table  width is \\nwider faciolingually in the distal half (Appendix 10v). \\nThe tapered mesial crown contour is nearly flat bucco-\\nlingually , whereas the distal surface is convex; the lin-\\ngual surface is convex mesiodistally .\\nAccentuated lingual tilt of the mandibular first \\nmolar: Recall that the crowns of all mandibular pos-\\nterior teeth, primary and secondary , appear to tilt lin-\\ngually , even more so on mandibular primary teeth. This \\nprimary mandibular first molar crown appears to lean \\ndecidedly toward the lingual accentuated by the very \\nprominent mesiobuccal cervical ridge, placing the buc-\\ncal cusp tips well over the root base.\\n8 The lingual cusp \\ntip may even be outside the lingual margin of the root \\n(Fig. 6-20B).\\nRoots of primary mandibular first molars : The \\ntwo roots (mesial and distal) are thin and slender and \\nwidely spread apart, with the root furcation very close \\nto the cervical line, so there is very little root trunk \\n(Appendix 10f). The mesial root is wider (square and \\nflat) and longer than the distal root. The distal root is \\nmore rounded, less broad, thinner, and shorter than the \\nmesial root.'),\n",

First, all \\nprimary teeth have erupted (which can be deduced \\nbased on their relatively small size, thin roots, \\nand the fact that all permanent succedaneous \\nteeth are forming apical to their primary tooth \\npredecessors). Therefore, the child is at least 2 \\nyears old. Next, the first  permanent molars are \\nnot even close to emerging, so the child must be \\nconsiderably younger than 6 years old. Finally, \\nno resorption has begun on the primary tooth \\nroots, so we can conclude that the child is closer \\nto 3 or 4 years old, rather than to 5 or 6, since \\nprimary teeth roots begin to resorb about 3 years \\nafter  eruption, which for the mandibular central \\n incisors would be about 3 and \\n1/2 years old.\\nCASE 2: Next, estimate the dental age of the \\nchild based on the shapes of teeth in the radio-\\ngraphs in Figure 6-25 before reading the answer.\\nAnswer: We see two mandibular premolar-shaped \\ncrowns (with no roots) forming under the roots of \\ntwo primary molars (evidenced by their divergent \\nroots). Distal to the primary second molars are \\nthe larger, erupted 6-year molars with incomplete \\nroots. The permanent maxillary canine and maxil-\\nlary second molar crowns (only partially visible) \\nare still within the bone. By deduction, the child \\nshould be over 6 but not yet 12. Since the primary \\nmolars’ roots are partially resorbed, the succeda-\\nneous premolars are close to emerging, making the \\nchild closer to 8 or 9 years old. If you could confirm \\nthat the succedaneous incisors were all erupted, \\nyou could estimate the age at just over 9 years old.\\nFIGURE 6-25.

The  relatively large size of the anterior \\nincisor crowns and lack of succedaneous teeth api-\\ncal to the roots indicate that the erupted incisors \\nare permanent, which places the age at 9 years \\nold or older. The 12-year molar has not emerged, \\nso the child is between 9 and 12 years old. Since \\nnone of the succedaneous canines or premolars \\nhave yet emerged, the dental age is around 9.\\nCASE 4: Finally, examine the unique denti-\\ntion in Figure 6-27 to determine which teeth \\nare present and which teeth are absent. Use \\nthe position from the midline as a guide to \\nlook for each tooth you expect to occupy \\nthat position, but always remember that the \\nspace could be occupied by the primary tooth \\nOR its succedaneous tooth. Also, realize that \\nspaces are not always present when a tooth is \\nmissing. The teeth on either side of the space \\nmay move together and close the space either \\nthrough orthodontic  treatment or due to a \\ncommon tendency for teeth distal to a space \\nto move (drift) into, and close, the space. \\nTherefore, if a space is not occupied by the \\nexpected primary or secondary tooth, it may \\nbe because the tooth has been extracted or is \\nmissing, and you will have to adjust your posi-\\ntioning from the midline accordingly.\\nFIGURE 6-26.

Instead, these teeth look \\nlike permanent canines, followed distally by first \\npremolars. We, therefore, need to suspect that \\nthe lateral incisors are missing or still unerupted \\n(impacted) within the maxillae. The teeth distal \\nto the first premolars, which in an adult dentition \\nshould be the second premolars, instead resemble \\nsmall maxillary first molars, followed by larger \\nmaxillary first molars. This leads us to conclude \\nthat the smaller molars, in the place of the maxil-\\nlary second premolars, could be primary second \\nmolars (resembling the larger emerged 6-year \\nfirst molars just distal to them). Since the 12-year \\nsecond molars are also present (though partially \\ncut off in the photo), the patient would be at least \\n12 years old. If that is true, we need to ask why \\nthere are no secondary lateral incisors or second \\npremolars, and why the primary second molars \\nare still present. Obtain a good history (to deter-\\nmine which teeth have been extracted or have \\nbeen confirmed as missing) along with excellent \\nradiographs to see whether the secondary lateral \\nincisors or second premolars are still unerupted \\nwithin the bone (impacted). If the lateral incisors \\nare not present and never formed, they would \\nbe considered congenitally absent (that is, as a \\nresult of factors existing at birth). If the primary \\nsecond molars were maintained into the adult \\ndentition (usually because the second premolars \\nwere congenitally absent), the primary teeth in an \\nadult would be called retained deciduous teeth.\\nMore on the topic of missing teeth will be pre-\\nsented in the chapter on dental anomalies.\\nFIGURE 6-27 Learning Case 4: Identify each visible tooth in the unique dentition of this 15-year-old.

This chapter focuses on how external root mor-\\nphology affects the prevention and progression of \\ndisease of the supporting structures called the periodon-\\ntium, and how tooth support and stability are affected \\nwhen the supporting structures of the tooth become \\ndiseased. An emphasis is placed on periodontal disease \\ninitiation, the measurements and descriptions that can \\nbe used to differentiate periodontal health from disease, \\nand the therapies that can be used to arrest or prevent \\nthe disease. The important relationship of periodontal \\ndisease relative to the placement of fillings and crowns \\nand the relevance of root anatomy to the removal of \\nharmful deposits that can form on the roots are also \\nintroduced.\\nOBJECTIVES\\nThis chapter is designed to prepare the learner to per-\\nform the following:\\n• Identify the components of a healthy periodontium.\\n• List the functions of gingiva, the periodontal liga-\\nment, alveolar bone, and cementum.\\n• Describe and recognize the signs of gingivitis, perio-\\ndontitis, and gingival recession.\\n• Describe the periodontal measurements that can \\nbe used to differentiate periodontal diseases from \\nperiodontal health and record these findings on a \\ndental chart.\\n• Describe the relationship of periodontal disease \\nwith restorations placed close to the gingival \\nattachment (dentogingival junction).\\n• Describe the relationship of root morphology with \\ntooth support.\\n• List contemporary methods of periodontal therapy.\\n• Describe challenges for periodontal instrumentation \\nrelative to root anatomy.'),\n",

GINGIVA\\nThe gingiva [JIN je va] is the part of the oral tissue \\n(oral mucosa ) covered by keratinized epithelium. It \\ncovers the alveolar processes of the jaws and surrounds \\nthe portions of the teeth near where the root and crown \\njoin (cervical portion). The gingiva is the only visible \\npart of the periodontium that can be seen in the mouth \\nduring an oral examination.\\n1. APPEARANCE OF HEALTHY GINGIVA\\nHealthy gingiva varies in appearance from individual to \\nindividual and in different areas of the same mouth. It \\nis usually pink or coral pink (Fig. 7-2), but in many per-\\nsons with darkly colored and black skin, and in many \\npersons of Mediterranean origin, healthy gingiva may \\nhave brown masking pigmentation (melanin pigmenta-\\ntion) (Fig. 7-3). Healthy gingiva is also resilient and firm \\nand does not bleed when probed. Its surface texture is \\nstippled, similar to that of an orange peel. The margins \\nof healthy gingiva are thin in profile and knife edged. \\nThe shape of the facial gingival margin around each \\ntooth somewhat parallels the cementoenamel junction \\n(CEJ), so it is shaped like a parabolic arch (similar in \\nshape to the McDonald’s arches). Surface stippling and \\nthe parabolic arch pattern around each anterior tooth \\nare evident in Figure 7-4. Characteristics of normal gin-\\ngiva are listed later in Table 7-1 along with the traits of \\ndiseased gingiva.\\n2. ZONES OF GINGIVA\\nGingiva can be divided into several zones as shown \\nin Figure 7-5 . Beginning at the gingival margin , the \\nzones include the free gingiva and interdental papilla, \\nthe free gingival groove (when present), attached gin-\\ngiva (highly keratinized and rich in collagen), and the \\nmucogingival junction. The alveolar mucosa is the \\nmovable tissue rich in blood vessels that lines the part \\nof the mouth between the attached gingiva and the lips, \\ncheeks, and tongue.\\na. Free Gingiva\\nThe zone closest to the tooth crown is the free gin-\\ngiva, which is the tissue that is not firmly attached to \\nthe tooth or alveolar bone. It surrounds each tooth to \\nform a collar of tissue with a potential space or gin-\\ngival sulcus  (crevice) hidden between itself and the \\ntooth. Free gingiva extends from the gingival margin \\n(the edge of gingiva closest to the chewing or incising \\nFIGURE 7-3.

The interdental gingiva or \\ninterproximal papilla [pah PILL ah] (plural is papillae \\n[pa PILL ee]) is that part of the free gingiva between \\ntwo adjacent teeth. A healthy papilla conforms to the \\nspace between two teeth, so it is very thin near where \\nthe adjacent teeth contact. There is a depression in the \\ngingival tissue of the interproximal papilla just apical to \\nthe tooth contact called a col. The papilla “hides” the \\ninterproximal portion of the gingival sulcus that sur-\\nrounds each tooth.

Care must be \\ntaken to avoid damaging the papilla in the process.\\nThe gingival sulcus is not seen visually but can be \\nevaluated with a periodontal probe since it is actually a \\npotential space between the tooth surface and the nar-\\nrow unattached cervical collar of free gingiva (Fig. 7-6). \\nThe gingival sulcus is lined with the sulcular epithe-\\nlium. It extends from the free gingival margin to the \\njunctional epithelium (averaging 0.69 mm in depth).\\n2 \\nJunctional epithelium or epithelial attachment (seen in \\ncross section in Fig. 7-1) is a band of tissue at the most \\napical portion of the gingival sulcus that attaches the \\ngingiva to the tooth.

The periodontal probe usually \\npenetrates slightly into the junctional epithelium, hence \\nthe difference between the depth determined through \\nclinical probing and the depth seen on a microscopic \\ncross section.\\n3 (At the end of this chapter, there are data \\non sulcus depths obtained by Dr. Woelfel.)\\nSometimes, during the process of eruption of the man-\\ndibular last molar through the mucosa, a flap of tissue may \\nremain over part of the chewing surface called an opercu-\\nlum (Fig. 7-7). This operculum can easily be irritated dur-\\ning chewing and become infected (called pericoronitis).\\nb. Attached Gingiva\\nAttached gingiva is a band or zone of coral pink, kera-\\ntinized mucosa that is firmly bound to the underlying \\nbone (Fig. 7-5). It extends from the free gingiva (at the \\nfree gingival groove if present) to the readily  movable \\nalveolar mucosa. The width of attached gingiva nor-\\nmally varies from 3 to 12 mm. Keratinized gingiva  \\nis a term used to describe both the free and attached \\ngingiva since they both contain keratin, a protein \\nalso found in skin and hair, which provides surface \\n toughness. Attached gingiva is most often widest on \\nthe facial aspect of maxillary anterior teeth and on the \\n lingual aspect of mandibular molars. It is narrowest on \\nthe facial aspect of mandibular premolars.\\n4\\nc. Alveolar Mucosa\\nThe mucogingival junction (line) (Fig. 7-5) is a scal-\\nloped junction between attached gingiva and the looser, \\nredder alveolar mucosa. Alveolar mucosa is dark pink \\nto red due to its increased blood supply and a thinner \\nepithelium covering. It is more delicate, nonkerati-\\nnized, and less firmly attached to the underlying bone \\nthan the attached gingiva, so it is more displaceable. \\nIf you palpate these two types of tissues in your own \\nmouth, you will feel the difference in firmness. This \\nmovable alveolar mucosa is found in three places: \\nfacially next to maxillary attached gingiva, facially next \\nto the mandibular attached gingiva, and lingually \\nnext to mandibular attached gingiva. It is not found \\nlingual to maxillary teeth since the hard palate has \\nattached keratinized tissue continuous with the lingual \\ngingiva. Therefore, a mucogingival  junction is present \\non the facial and lingual aspects of mandibular gingiva, \\nbut only on the facial aspect of maxillary gingiva.\\n3.

Support\\nThe gingiva supports the tooth by means of attachment \\ncoronal to the crest of the alveolar bone that forms a \\ndentogingival junction from tooth to gingiva near the \\nCEJ.5 It includes the junctional epithelium  (average \\nwidth just <1 mm) and the connective tissue attach-\\nment (average width slightly >1 mm) (Fig. 7-1). The \\nmore coronal band (junctional epithelium) attaches \\ngingiva to the tooth by cell junctions (called hemides-\\nmosomes, or half desmosomes), while the more apical \\nband (connective tissue) attaches gingiva to cementum \\nby several gingival fiber groups made up of connective \\ntissue called collagen.\\nb. Protection\\nThe gingiva protects underlying tissue because it is \\ncomposed of dense fibrous connective tissue covered by \\na relatively tough tissue layer called keratinized epithe-\\nlium.\\n6 It is resistant to bacterial, chemical, thermal, and \\nmechanical irritants. Keratinized gingiva helps prevent \\nthe spread of inflammation to deeper underlying peri-\\nodontal tissues. However, the sulcular lining (epithe-\\nlium) and junctional epithelium of the marginal gingiva \\nand interdental papillae provide less protection. Since \\nthese areas are not keratinized, they are more perme-\\nable to bacterial products, providing only a weak bar-\\nrier to bacterial irritants, and may even allow bacterial \\npenetration in aggressive forms of periodontal diseases.\\nHealthy gingiva is protected by ideally positioned \\nand contoured natural teeth and well-contoured res-\\ntorations. The protection provided by ideal tooth con-\\ntours, including anatomic heights of contour, helps to \\nminimize injury from food during mastication (chew-\\ning) since food is diverted away from the thin gingi-\\nval margin and the nonkeratinized sulcus (recall Fig. \\n1-37). However, poor tooth or restoration contours, \\nespecially overcontoured restorations, contribute to the \\nretention of bacteria-laden dental plaque that may pre-\\ndispose to gingival and periodontal diseases and will be \\ndescribed in more detail later. Ideal proximal tooth con-\\ntours and contacts help prevent food from  impacting \\nbetween teeth and damaging the interdental papilla or \\n contributing to interproximal periodontal disease. Be \\naware, however, that even ideal tooth contours do not \\nprevent the formation of bacterial plaque and develop-\\nment of periodontal disease.\\nc. Esthetics\\nIn health, gingiva covers the roots of teeth, and the \\ninterdental papillae normally fill the gingival embra-\\nsure areas between adjacent teeth (Figs. 7-2 and 7-4). \\nThe shape of healthy gingiva contributes to what we \\nconsider to be an esthetic smile.\\n7 For the anterior teeth, \\nthe gingival margin of each tooth is almost parabolic \\nin shape with the gingival line for the maxillary cen-\\ntral incisors and canines at about the same level, but \\nthe gingival line for the lateral incisors is about 1 mm \\ncoronal (more gingiva is visible). Symmetry , especially \\nbetween the maxillary central incisors, is essential. \\nWhen the patient smiles, the upper lip should ideally \\nbe at about the level of the free gingival margin of the \\ncentral incisors and canines, and the lower lip should \\njust cover the incisal edges. An example of gingiva that \\nis not esthetic is seen in Figure 7-8.\\nd. Phonetics\\nPhonetics pertains to the articulation of sounds and \\nspeech. Gingival tissues should cover the roots of the \\nteeth, but if exposure of the roots occurs, especially \\ninterproximally, speech may be affected as air passes \\nthrough the open embrasure spaces. Figure 7-8 shows \\na patient who has had past periodontal disease with \\nsevere tissue loss that contributes to poor phonetics as \\nwell as poor esthetics.\\n4. FUNCTIONS OF THE HEALTHY \\nPERIODONTAL LIGAMENT, ALVEOLAR \\nBONE, AND CEMENTUM\\nThe entire periodontal ligament consists of numerous \\ncollagen fiber bundles, which attach the cementum \\nof the tooth root to the alveolar bony sockets. These \\nfibers, from alveolar crest to the apex, include  alveolar \\nFIGURE 7-8.  Severe gingival recession on a patient with \\nprevious periodontal disease.

GINGIVITIS\\nTraditionally , periodontal disease (inflammation in the \\nperiodontium) begins as gingivitis, an inflammatory \\ncondition confined to and altering the gingival tissues. \\nAlterations in the gingiva may reflect gingivitis alone, \\nactive slight periodontitis, more advanced disease, or \\nevidence of previous disease that has been arrested. \\nGingival inflammation results over time from the \\nresponse of the body to the harmful metabolic prod-\\nucts of bacterial colonies within dental plaque that are \\nin close proximity to gingival tissues. The earliest indi-\\ncation of gingivitis on a microscopic level involves an \\nincrease in inflammatory cells and breakdown of the \\nconnective tissue (collagen) in the gingiva. This leads \\nto an increase in tissue fluids ( edema, that is swelling), \\nprolife ration of small blood vessels (redness), inflamma-\\ntory cells, and some loss of the integrity of the epithe-\\nlium (seen as ulceration). As this breakdown progresses, \\nchanges in the tissues can be clinically observed.\\nClinically, gingival characteristics that should be \\nevaluated as indicators of gingival health (vs. disease) \\ninclude its shape and size, color, consistency, and \\nsurface texture, and the presence or absence of bleed-\\ning and/or suppuration (also called purulence, puru-\\nlent exudate, or pus). Visually, the inflammation and \\nedema of dental plaque–induced gingivitis can result \\nin  redness; rolled, swollen margins; smooth and shiny \\nsurface texture or loss of stippling (Fig. 7-10); and loss \\nof resiliency where gingival tissue can be depressed \\nand free gingiva can be deflected from the tooth when \\na stream of air is directed toward it. Additionally, gin-\\ngivitis can result in pronounced bleeding upon probing \\n(Fig. 7-10B and especially D), spontaneous bleeding \\n(Fig. 7-10E), and, in some cases, suppuration that \\ncan be expressed (squeezed out) from the sulcus. See \\nTable 7-1 for normal gingival characteristics compared \\nto descriptions of tissue exhibiting gingivitis.\\n8–12\\nB. PERIODONTITIS\\nIn the classic progression of disease, gingivitis, if \\nuntreated, may progress to periodontitis. As with the \\ngingiva, the adjacent periodontal ligament, bone, and \\ncementum are at risk for breakdown during inflamma-\\ntion with resultant loss of bone height and periodontal \\nligament. This occurs when inflammatory breakdown \\nextends from the gingiva to the periodontal ligament \\nand bone and when the junctional epithelium (which \\nnormally attaches to tooth at the CEJ) migrates apically \\nonto the root because the connective tissue attachment \\nhas broken down. Alveolar bone loss associated with \\nperiodontal disease is best appreciated in dental radio-\\ngraphs. Although the immune system normally protects \\nthe periodontium, a person’s immune response against \\nbacteria can also result in the production of host prod-\\nucts that stimulate bone loss (breakdown) known as \\nbone resorption. In Figure 7-11B, the crestal alveolar \\nbone height in a person with advanced periodontal \\n disease is no longer at predisease levels (Fig. 7-11A).\\nChronic periodontitis is the most common form of \\nperiodontal disease. It usually progresses slowly, is most \\nANATOMY OF DISEASED PERIODONTIUMSECTION III\\ncrest fibers, horizontal, oblique, and apical fibers \\n(refer back to Fig. 7-1). Free gingival fibers attach the \\nfree gingiva to the cementum. A sixth group, trans-\\nseptal fibers, is not seen in Figure 7-1 since they run \\ndirectly from the root (cementum) of one tooth to the \\ncementum of the adjacent tooth at a level between the \\nfree gingiva and alveolar crest fibers. The periodon-\\ntal ligament, especially the oblique fibers, provides \\nthe majority of support for the teeth and resistance \\nto forces such as those encountered during chewing \\n(mastication). This ligament is a viable structure that, \\nin health, is capable of adaptation and remodeling. \\nHealthy bone levels can be best appreciated on radio-\\ngraphs.

Features may include rapid attachment loss \\nand bone destruction, a familial pattern, and abnormal-\\nities in the immune system.

In gingival \\nrecession, the gingival margin is apical to the CEJ, and \\nthe papillae may be blunted and/or rounded, and no lon-\\nger fill the interproximal embrasure. Gingival recession \\nis often seen in older individuals, hence the  reference \\nto an older person as being “long in the tooth.” It may \\nbe part of an active process of periodontal disease or \\nFIGURE 7-12.

TOOTH MOBILITY\\nTooth mobility is the movement of a tooth in response \\nto applied forces. 22 Teeth may become mobile due to \\nrepeated excessive occlusal forces, inflammation, and \\nweakened periodontal support (often associated with a \\nwidened periodontal ligament space as noted on radio-\\ngraphs). The healthy periodontal ligament is about \\n0.2 mm wide, decreasing to only 0.1 mm with advanced \\nage. When a tooth is subjected to forces from chewing \\n(mastication) or bruxism (grinding), movements are \\nFIGURE 7-18.

Probe depths (six per tooth) are recorded during the initial exami-\\nnation (initial probe depths) in the three boxes for three facial depth locations on each facial surface and three boxes for three lingual \\ndepth locations. After initial periodontal therapy has been completed, they should ideally be recorded again in four to six weeks. They \\nshould also be recorded at regular periodontal maintenance therapy appointments. This permits easy comparison to identify sites \\nthat respond to treatment and those that do not respond. Bleeding on probing (BOP) is denoted by a red dot over the probe depth \\nreadings as on the facial surfaces of teeth No. 2 (mesial, midfacial, and distal), No. 3 (distal), and No. 5 (mesial and distal); and \\nlingually on all mesial and distal surfaces.

PROBE DEPTHS\\nProbing the depth of the potential space between the \\ntooth and gingiva (called the gingival sulcus or crev-\\nice) is a critical periodontal finding that is routinely \\nperformed in dental offices and may indicate the pres-\\nence of periodontal disease.\\n26,27 A blunt-tipped instru-\\nment with millimeter markings called a periodontal \\nprobe ( Fig. 7-20 ) is inserted into the gingival sulcus \\n(seen on anterior teeth in Fig. 7-21 and posterior tooth \\nin Fig. 7-22 ). In the presence of periodontal disease, \\nthis gingival sulcus may be called a periodontal pocket. \\nProbing depth (referred to as pocket depth if periodon-\\ntal disease is present) is the distance from the gingi-\\nval margin to the apical portion of the gingival sulcus. \\nProbing depths in healthy gingival sulci normally range \\nfrom 1 to 3 mm. A depth of greater than 3 mm is a pos-\\nsible cause for concern. However, if gingival tissues are \\novergrown (as may be seen during tooth eruption, or \\nas a side effect from some medications), a pocket depth \\nreading of 4 mm or greater (called a pseudopocket) \\nmay be present even in the absence of periodontitis. On \\nthe other hand, if there is gingival recession where the \\ngingival margin is apical to the CEJ, there may be shal-\\nlow probing depths in the presence of true periodontal \\ndisease. Therefore, the critical determinant of whether \\nperiodontitis has occurred is measured by the amount \\nof attachment loss (to be described shortly).\\nFIGURE 7-20.

PROBING TECHNIQUE\\nThe intent is to probe a sulcus apically just to the attach-\\nment, although in reality the probe usually broaches \\n(impinges on) some of the attachment, even in health. \\nThe probe should be “walked around” the tooth with \\na light force to ensure a tactile sense and to minimize \\nprobing beyond the base of the pocket. When the \\ndepth of the sulcus/pocket has been reached, resilient \\nresistance is encountered. The probe should be angled \\nslightly toward the crown or root surface to prevent \\nit from engaging or being impeded by the pocket wall \\n(seen best midfacially in Fig. 7-22A). Probing depths \\nare generally recorded as the deepest measurement for \\neach of the six areas around each tooth. On the facial \\nsurface, three areas are recorded while moving in very \\nsmall steps within the sulcus starting in the distal \\ninterproximal, stepping around to the midbuccal, and \\nfinally stepping around to the mesial interproximal \\n(seen when probing the facial surface of tooth No. 7 \\nin Fig. 7-21B–D). Interproximally, when the teeth are \\nin proximal contact, the probe should progress toward \\nthe contact until it touches both adjacent teeth before \\nangling it approximately 10 to 15° buccal (or lingual) \\nto the tooth axis line (seen most clearly in Fig. 7-21A,D \\nand Fig. 7-22B). When there is no adjacent tooth, the \\nprobe is not angled. The three facial readings to record \\nare the deepest readings for mesial interproximal, mid-\\nbuccal, and distal interproximal. Similarly, three areas \\nare recorded while probing around the lingual of the \\ntooth.\\nC. GINGIVAL MARGIN LEVEL (GINGIVAL \\nRECESSION OR NONRECESSION)\\nBefore any periodontal disease has occurred, the gin-\\ngival margin level of a young healthy person is slightly \\ncoronal to the CEJ, which is the reference point. If the \\ngingival margin is apical to the CEJ, there has been \\ngingival recession, and the root is exposed (seen most \\nobviously in Fig. 7-12B).\\nBy convention, the following denotes the gingival \\nmargin level:\\nNegative (–) numbers denote that the gingival • \\n margin is coronal to the CEJ. Normally, after tooth \\neruption is complete, the gingival margin is slightly \\ncoronal to the CEJ (about 1 mm on the labial and \\nlingual aspects, and about 2 mm interproximally). If \\nthe gingival margin is more coronal to the CEJ than \\nthose dimensions, there is an excess (overgrowth) of \\ngingiva or the tooth is partially erupted.\\nZero (0) denotes that the gingiva is at the CEJ. There • \\nis no gingival recession.\\nPositive (+) numbers denote recession (the gingival • \\nlevel is apical to the CEJ).\\n1.

CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS (SAME \\nAS CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL)\\nClinical attachment loss (clinical attachment level)  \\nrefers to the distance from the CEJ to the apical extent \\n(depth) of the periodontal sulcus. It is a measurement \\nthat indicates how much support has been lost and is, \\ntherefore, a critical determinant of whether periodontal \\ndisease has occurred.\\n1. TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINE CLINICAL \\nATTACHMENT LOSS\\nAdd the probing depth and the gingival margin level \\nmeasurements together to obtain the clinical attach-\\nment loss. A patient with a 3 mm pocket and a  gingival \\nlevel of +2 (i.e., 2 mm of recession) has 5 mm of \\n attachment loss. A patient with a 3-mm pocket and a \\ngingival level of –2 mm (the gingiva covers the CEJ \\nby 2 mm) has only 1 mm of attachment loss. Study \\nthe example of clinical attachment calculation on the \\ntooth in Figure 7-23 where the sulcus depth is 1 mm \\n(Fig. 7-23A) and the gingiva has receded 1 mm (+1 \\nmm loss in Fig. 7-23B), so the total attachment loss is \\n+2 mm. Clinical attachment loss can be severe even \\nwith minimal pocket depths if there is considerable \\ngingival recession. On the other hand, there may be no \\nattachment loss even with deep pockets if pseudopock-\\nets are present, that is, pockets due to an enlargement \\nof gingiva possibly caused by plaque accumulation next \\nto ill-fitting restoration margins, as a side effect of cer-\\ntain medications, or due to hormonal changes.\\nPeriodontists also make interproximal measurements \\nof the gingival margin level that is a more challenging \\ntask. The severity of periodontal disease can therefore \\nbe accurately determined at the six sites around each \\ntooth by measurements.\\nE. BLEEDING ON PROBING\\nBleeding on probing  occurs when bacterial plaque \\naffects the gingival sulcular epithelium, resulting in \\ninflammation in the underlying connective tissue. \\nBleeding visible from the gingival margin after probing \\nis an important indicator of inflammation (Figs. 7-24A,B \\nand Fig. 7-10B,D,E).\\n1. TECHNIQUE TO DOCUMENT \\nBLEEDING ON PROBING\\nWhen bleeding is noted after probing several teeth, \\nteeth that exhibit bleeding can be recorded at each prob-\\ning site on the chart as a red dot above the probe depth. \\nThe percentage of sites that bleed can be calculated by \\ndividing the number of bleeding sites by the number of \\ntotal sites (where total sites equal the number of teeth \\npresent times six probe sites per tooth). Bleeding sites \\nare charted in Figure 7-18, and a percentage has been \\ncalculated for four teeth.\\nFIGURE 7-23. Measurements to determine clinical attachment loss (level). A. First, the sulcus is probed (at 1 mm). B. Next, the \\nlevel of the gingiva is determined with a positive number indicating gingival recession (at +1 mm from the dotted line, which is the \\nCEJ). When the two numbers are added together, the amount of attachment loss is determined. In this case, the probing depth of \\n1 mm and the gingival level of + 1 (1 mm recession) results in an attachment loss of 2 mm.'),\n",

FURCATION INVOLVEMENT\\nA furcation is the branching point between roots on a \\nmultirooted tooth. In the absence of disease, furcations \\ncannot be clinically probed because they are filled in \\nwith bone and periodontal attachment. With advancing \\nperiodontal disease, however, attachment loss and bone \\nloss may reach a furcation area resulting in a furcation \\ninvolvement.\\n28,29 Pockets that extend into the furcation \\ncreate areas with difficult access for the dentist and den-\\ntal hygienist to clean during regular office visits, and \\nare a real challenge for patients to reach and clean dur-\\ning their normal home care. Therefore, these areas of \\nfurcation involvement readily accumulate soft plaque \\ndeposits and mineralized calculus (seen on an extracted \\nteeth in Fig. 7-25). These deposits frequently become \\nimpossible to remove and may provide a  pathway for \\nperiodontal disease to continue to progress.\\nInitially , there may be an incipient (initial or begin-\\nning) furcation involvement. As disease progresses into \\nthe furcation (interradicular) area, attachment loss and \\nbone loss will begin to progress horizontally between \\nthe roots. At that point, a furcation probe (such as a \\nNabor’s probe with a blunt end and curved design) can \\nprobe into a subgingival furcation area. It can be used \\nto detect the concavity between roots ( Fig. 7-26). The \\nfirst sign of detectable furcation involvement is termed \\ngrade I  and can progress to a grade II  involvement \\nwhen the probe can hook the furcation roof (the part \\nof the root forming the most coronal portion of the fur-\\ncal area) as demonstrated in Figure 7-27A. In the most \\nextreme circumstances, the furcation probe may  actually \\nextend from the furcation of one tooth aspect to the fur-\\ncation on another tooth aspect. This is referred to as a \\nthrough-and-through (grade III) furcation involvement \\n(Fig. 7-27B ). (A summary of the grades of furcation \\ninvolvement is presented later in Table 7-4.)\\nIt is important to remember where to insert a probe in \\norder to confirm furcation involvement (summarized in \\nTable 7-3). Recall that mandibular molar furcations are \\nlocated between mesial and distal roots near the middle \\nof the buccal surface (midbuccal) and middle of the lin-\\ngual surface (midlingual) as illustrated in Figure 7-28A \\nFIGURE 7-25.

TECHNIQUE FOR DETERMINING LACK \\nOF ATTACHED GINGIVA\\nBoth visual observations and measurements are \\nrequired for detecting a lack of gingival attachment. In \\nthe visual method, a mucogingival defect is confirmed \\nwhen a periodontal probe is moved incisocervically (or \\nocclusocervically) as it is pressed gently against the \\n tissue surface at the mucogingival line, and movement \\nor blanching occurs at the margin (Fig. 7-34B). When \\nusing measurements, first measure the width of kerati-\\nnized gingiva from the gingival margin to the mucog-\\ningival junction. Then place the periodontal probe \\nwithin the gingival sulcus, and if the periodontal probe \\ndepth reaches or exceeds the width of keratinized tis-\\nsue, a mucogingival defect is confirmed. See a clinical \\nexample using measurements to confirm a mucogingi-\\nval defect in Figure 7-33A and B. This can be charted \\nas a horizontal wavy line placed over the root apical to \\nrecession readings (seen in the chart in Fig. 7-18).\\nH. THE PLAQUE SCORE (INDEX)\\nBacterial dental plaque  (biofilm) is a thin layer con-\\ntaining organized microorganisms that loosely adheres \\nto teeth, but it can be removed with proper tooth \\nbrushing and flossing. It is an almost invisible layer \\nthat accumulates on teeth in the absence of excellent \\noral hygiene. Therefore, utilizing a mechanism to iden-\\ntify the location of this nearly invisible plaque can be \\nhelpful when teaching plaque removal techniques, and \\nwhen monitoring a person’s success using specific oral \\nhygiene techniques designed to reduce and eliminate \\nhis or her plaque.\\nThe metabolism of these attached, organized colonies \\nof microorganisms contributes to the inflammation of \\ngingival tissue associated with gingivitis, the destruction \\nof bone and periodontal ligament associated with perio-\\ndontitis, and the destruction of mineralized tooth struc-\\nture during the formation of dental decay (dental caries). \\nMany factors contribute to plaque retention, including \\ntooth malpositions and malformations, the irregular \\nsurface of advancing dental caries (decay), defective res-\\ntorations, and accumulation of calculus (tartar).\\nFIGURE 7-34. Visual test for a mucogingival defect. A. A loss of attached gingiva is suspected at tooth No. 24, which has a very \\nnarrow zone of keratinized gingiva. B.

TECHNIQUE TO DETERMINE (CALCULATE) \\nA PLAQUE SCORE (INDEX)31\\nPlaque can be stained with disclosing solution, a dye \\nthat is absorbed by bacterial plaque ( Fig. 7-35). When \\nthis solution is swished in the mouth, four tooth sur-\\nfaces of each tooth can be evaluated for the presence \\nof the stained plaque: mesial, facial, distal, and lingual.\\nThe plaque index  is calculated as the percentage of \\nsites with plaque divided by the total sites (number of \\nteeth times four). Note: Disclosing solutions should \\nnot be used until periodontal measurements and the \\noral physical exam have been made and reviewed since \\nthe color change to oral tissues from the solution may \\ninfluence the ability to observe the initial findings. \\nA charting example of plaque score calculation is pre-\\nsented for four teeth in Figure 7-18.\\nRELATIONSHIP OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE \\nAND RESTORATIONS (FILLINGS)SECTION V\\nRELATIONSHIP OF TOOTH SUPPORT AND ROOT \\nMORPHOLOGY\\n33SECTION VI\\nA healthy biologic width32 of attached gingiva (known \\nas the dentogingival junction) includes the junctional \\nepithelium (about 1 mm wide), as well as a band of \\nconnective tissue fibers (about 1 mm wide) attaching \\nthe gingiva to the cementum. Care must be taken when \\nrestoring teeth to protect this biologic width of attach-\\nment. If a restoration encroaches into the attachment, it \\ncould be a factor in initiating periodontal disease (peri-\\nodontitis/bone loss/attachment loss), gingival recession, \\nor chronically inflamed gingival tissue. Further, it is usu-\\nally recommended that the margins of artificial crowns \\nand inlays be kept at least 3 mm from the osseous crest. \\nTherefore, if a restoration is to be placed to restore an \\narea of decay that has destroyed tooth structure very \\nclose to bone, it is advisable to perform a  surgical \\nprocedure called crown lengthening to ensure that the \\nrestoration does not encroach on the biologic width. \\nThis is especially critical on teeth where esthetics is a \\nfactor. Clinical crown lengthening is a procedure that \\nincreases the extent of supragingival tooth structure by \\nremoving gingival tissue or apical positioning gingival \\ntissue, and usually removing some supporting bone.\\nFurther, a defective restoration, especially one that is \\novercontoured or is not flush with the tooth structure, \\nmay retain bacterial plaque more readily , so it could be \\nan initiating factor for periodontal disease. Therefore, \\nit is always important to keep in mind that when teeth \\nmust be restored, ideal tooth contours, as have been \\ndiscussed in the earlier chapters of this text, should be \\nreproduced.\\nThe area of root attachment is of primary importance \\nto the stability and health of a tooth. Root attachment \\narea depends on root length, the number of roots, and \\nthe cross-sectional diameter of the root from the CEJ to \\nthe apex. It also depends on the presence or absence of \\nconcavities and other root curvatures (Fig. 7-36). These \\nfeatures greatly influence the resistance of a tooth to \\nocclusal and other forces, particularly when they are \\napplied in a lateral (buccolingual) direction.\\nIn health, prior to periodontal disease, connective \\ntissue fibers insert into cementum on the entire root \\nsurface. This attachment includes the insertion of the \\ngingival fibers (coronal to the bone level) near the CEJ, \\nand periodontal ligament fiber insertions along the \\nmajority of the root. Long roots and wide cross-sectional \\ntooth diameters increase support. Concavities and other \\nroot curvatures increase periodontal support in two \\nways. First, they increase the total surface area. Second, \\nthe concave configuration provides multidirectional \\nfiber orientation, which makes the tooth more stable \\nand resistant to occlusal forces. For example, a root with \\na mesial concavity is more resistant to buccolingual \\nforces than a tooth that is conical or convex (Fig. 7-36). \\nVertical and longitudinal depressions and concave areas \\noccur commonly on the mesial and distal root surfaces \\nof many anterior and most posterior teeth (as described \\nin earlier chapters). More coronally located root depres-\\nsions are also found on the mesial surface of maxillary \\nfirst premolars (both on the root and crown) and on \\nmolar root surfaces just coronal to furcations.\\nLikewise, multirooted teeth have increased support \\nand resistance to applied forces. For those teeth, the'),\n",

Additionally, \\nconvergence or divergence of roots influences support. \\nDivergent roots increase stability and allow for more \\ninterradicular bone support (recall Fig. 7-30).\\nAnother important factor for determining tooth sta-\\nbility is the degree of root taper. Teeth with conical \\nroots, such as mandibular first premolars, tend to have \\nthe majority of their root area (>60%) in the coronal \\n half of the root, and much less area (only about 40%) \\nin the apical half of the root (Fig. 7-37).\\n34 The degree of \\nroot taper influences the support once periodontal dis-\\nease has occurred. A conical root that has lost only 50% \\nof the bone height may have lost more than 60% of its \\nperiodontal ligament. This is because a smaller pro-\\nportion of the root area is present near the apex. For \\nseverely conical roots, the apical half of the root may \\naccount for even less attachment area than seen in \\nFigure 7-37.\\nBased on root area alone, one would generally \\nexpect to find the maxillary canine to be the most \\nstable  single-rooted tooth, and the mandibular central \\nincisors to be the least stable. For posterior teeth, one \\nwould expect maxillary first molars, with their three \\ndivergent roots, to be more stable than third molars, \\nwhich frequently have fused roots. While these rules \\ngenerally apply, additional factors, such as the presence \\nor absence of inflammatory periodontal disease and \\nexcessive occlusal forces, may greatly influence tooth \\nstability. Also, the density and structure of the support-\\ning bone have an influence on tooth stability.\\nFIGURE 7-36.

Both prevent a normal \\nconnective tissue attachment and may channel disease \\ninto the furcation area. Radicular palatal grooves  (pala-\\ntal gingival grooves) occur on maxillary incisors and \\nreadily collect and retain plaque, which can frequently \\nlead to periodontal destruction ( Fig. 7-39). Root frac-\\ntures also predispose periodontal destruction (loss \\nof attachment of the periodontal ligament) along the \\nfracture line.\\nCurrently , a wide range of techniques is available to treat \\nperiodontal problems. Nonsurgical periodontal therapy tra-\\nditionally requires effective root planing [PLAY ning] (i.e., \\nremoval of calculus and smoothing of the root using spe-\\ncially designed dental instruments), oral hygiene instruc-\\ntions, and the use of systemically administered antibiotics. \\nSustained-release antimicrobial and antibiotic agents can \\nbe locally administered to affected sites.

Regenerative periodontal surgery is intended to \\nform new cementum, new bone, and a new function-\\nally oriented periodontal ligament. Recent advances in \\nthe area of periodontal regeneration involve three basic \\nstrategies.

Supragingival calculus that forms on the \\nanatomic crown of the tooth is easier to remove than \\nsubgingival deposits on roots for several reasons. First, \\nhard deposits on crown surfaces are more visible and \\nare readily accessible when using dental instruments. \\nSoft deposits of plaque are relatively easy to remove on \\nthese surfaces by using excellent brushing and flossing \\ntechniques. Crown surfaces where calculus forms near \\nthe gingiva are mostly convex, which are easier to clean \\nthan the complex contours of roots, especially those on \\nposterior teeth that are multirooted. Finally, crowns are \\ncovered with enamel that is the hardest substance in the \\nbody (95% calcified). Enamel is nonporous, so damage \\nor removal of this tissue during instrumentation is not \\nas likely as removal of cementum that is much less hard \\n(less than about 65% calcified) and more porous.\\nWhen periodontal disease progresses to a point where \\nthere is attachment loss, the normal insertion of connec-\\ntive tissue fibers into cementum is lost. In this subgingi-\\nval environment, bacteria and their products, including \\nplaque, dental calculus, and bacterial products, absorb \\ninto irregularities on the root surface and hold onto the \\nbiofilm, increasing the chance for plaque retention and \\nperiodontal disease activity . Loss of  periodontal support \\nof the bone and ligament exposes complex root surfaces, \\ncreating a challenge for dental professionals to clean \\n(instrument) and for patients to maintain. Areas of deep \\npocketing are difficult to access, and a tight (fibrotic) \\npocket may impede access to the deepest sites.\\nInstrumentation on the root surface requires removal \\nof plaque and calculus on the root and, most signifi-\\ncantly , requires the removal of calculus, plaque, and bac-\\nterial products that were deposited into the irregularities \\nin cementum exposed to the oral environment during \\nperiodontal disease. This may require removal of some, \\nbut not all, of the cementum resulting in a cleaner and \\nsmoother surface. This process is known as periodontal \\nscaling and root planing [PLAY ning]. Periodontal scal-\\ning and root planing is a treatment procedure designed \\nto remove cementum or surface dentin that is rough, \\nimpregnated with calculus, or contaminated with toxins \\nor microorganisms. While root planing makes the root \\nclean, care must be taken, especially on exposed root \\nsurfaces, to avoid overinstrumenting the root resulting \\nin a compromise in root structure (recall Fig. 7-8).\\nFIGURE 7-40.

This challenge is \\ngenerally addressed by using ultrasonic instrumenta-\\ntion, that is, instruments that use high-frequency vibra-\\ntions to dislodge calculus and break apart bacterial cell \\nwalls. A combination of hand instruments and ultra-\\nsonic instruments can be used to remove a small por-\\ntion of the affected cementum through root planing.\\nSeveral areas of the root have been identified as the \\nmost difficult to instrument and as common areas for \\ndental calculus to be left following periodontal instru-\\nmentation.\\n31\\n1. The CEJ is difficult to instrument because, although \\naccessible, the irregularities in the surface where \\nenamel and cementum come together make it plaque \\nretentive. Due to these irregularities, calculus is fre-\\nquently confused with the CEJ (Fig. 7-41A and B)\\n2. Concavities (grooves) that appear at numerous loca-\\ntions on the root surface are challenging areas for \\nperiodontal instruments to access. Concavities are \\nmost prominent on the mesial aspect of the crown \\nand root of maxillary first premolars, the mesial \\naspects of mandibular first molars, and root areas just \\ncoronal to all furcations (Fig. 7-42). Grooves can also \\nbe the result of unusual tooth formation (Fig. 7-39).\\n3. Furcations present very unusual challenges to \\ninstrument. Before periodontal disease begins on \\n multirooted teeth, the periodontal attachment is \\nintact so furcations are not exposed to the oral \\nenvironment. With advancing periodontal disease \\nand bone loss, once furcations (deep within gingi-\\nval pockets) become exposed to plaque, it becomes \\ndifficult to gain access for root planing. It is fre-\\nquently impossible to reach these areas with dental \\ninstruments, and even ultrasonic instruments may \\nnot be able to negotiate into deep furcations. The \\nmaxillary trifurcation area is the most challenging \\nsite (Fig. 7-43). Additionally , the furcal areas (inte-\\nrior aspects between the roots) of molars frequently \\nhave concavities (depressions), further complicating \\naccess for instrumentation (Fig. 7-42). Furthermore, \\nsometimes the roots of multirooted teeth are in close \\napproximation,  making access with hand  instruments \\nimpossible and access with ultrasonic scalers difficult \\n(Fig. 7-44A). Reaching all root surfaces with instru-\\nments in order to remove deposits and clean root \\nsurfaces that have furcation involvement and con-\\ncavities requires a special knowledge of root anatomy \\nand advanced clinical skills. Imagine following the \\nsequence and angulations required for thoroughly \\nremoving deposits on the roots of a mandibular molar \\nas demonstrated in Figure 7-45 when the furcation \\ncontours and root concavities are “hidden” from view \\nwithin deep pockets. Periodontal surgery is recom-\\nmended for teeth with deep periodontal furcations.\\n4. Tooth contours at the line angles are also difficult to \\naccess.\\nFollow-up for patients who have had periodontal \\n disease: Patients who have had periodontal disease are \\nat risk for having recurrent periodontal disease.

The \\nnumber of pulp horns found within each cusped tooth \\n(molars, premolars, and canines) is normally one horn \\nper functional cusp, and in young incisors, it is three \\n(one horn in each of the three facial lobes, which is \\nthe same as one lobe per mamelon).

ROOT CANALS (PULP CANALS)\\nRoot canals (pulp canals) are the portions of the pulp cav-\\nity located within the root(s) of a tooth. Root canals con-\\nnect to the pulp chamber through canal orifices on the \\nfloor of the pulp chamber, and pulp canals open to the out-\\nside of the tooth through openings called apical foramina\\n(singular foramen) most commonly located at or near the \\nroot apex (Fig. 8-1). The shape and number of root canals \\nin any one root have been divided into four major ana-\\ntomic configurations or types (Fig. 8-2). The type I con-\\nfiguration has one canal, whereas types II, III, and IV have \\neither two canals or one canal that is spilt into two for part \\nof the root. The four canal types are defined as follows:\\nType I—one canal extends from the pulp chamber \\nto the apex.\\nType II—two separate canals leave the pulp cham-\\nber, but they join short of the apex to form one canal \\napically and one apical foramen.\\nType III—two separate canals leave the pulp cham-\\nber and remain separate, exiting the root apically as \\ntwo separate apical foramina.\\nType IV —one canal leaves the pulp chamber but \\ndivides in the apical third of the root into two separate \\ncanals with two separate apical foramina.\\nAccessory (or lateral) canals also occur, located \\nmost commonly in the apical third of the root ( Fig.\\n8-3A and B) and, in maxillary and mandibular molars, \\nare common in the furcation area.\\nA\\nTable 8-1 GUIDELINES FOR NUMBERS OF PULP HORNS IN ADULT TEETH\\nNO.

PULP SHAPE IN ANTERIOR TEETH \\n(INCISORS AND CANINES)\\na. Pulp Chamber and Pulp Horns \\nof Anterior Teeth\\nWhen an incisor is cut mesiodistally and viewed from \\nthe facial (or lingual) (similar to the view on dental \\nradiographs), the pulp chambers are broad and may \\nappear as three pulp horns. Only two horns can be seen \\nin the maxillary central incisors in Figure 8-5. However, \\nthe incisal border of the pulp wall (roof of the chamber) \\nof a young tooth may show the configuration of three \\nmamelons, that is, has developed with three pulp horns: \\nlocated mesially , centrally , and distally . (Recall, however, \\nthat there is an unusual peg lateral incisor that only has \\none pulp horn.) Knowing the number and location of \\nthese pulp horns becomes important when the tooth is \\nfractured or badly decayed and must be prepared for an \\nincisal restoration. When an anterior tooth is cut labio-\\nlingually and viewed from the proximal, the pulp cham-\\nbers taper to a point toward the incisal edge ( Fig. 8-6).\\nIn maxillary and mandibular canines, the incisal wall or \\nroof of the pulp chamber is often less pointed, having \\nonly one pulp horn (Fig. 8-7).\\nb. Root Canal(s) of Anterior Teeth\\nRecall that all anterior teeth are most likely to have one\\nroot. The number of root canals in each type of anterior \\ntooth is also most frequently one. Maxillary central inci-\\nsors, lateral incisors, and canines almost always have \\none canal (type I), whereas mandibular anterior teeth, \\nalthough most likely to have one canal, may have two \\narrangement is not feasible, keep the tooth moist by \\nfrequently dipping the surface being ground in water \\nor by dripping water onto the wheel with a medicine \\ndropper.

A \\nhigh-speed dental handpiece and bur will greatly \\nfacilitate your exploration of the insides of teeth.\\nAs you examine different sides of each kind of tooth, \\nnotice how the external contours of the pulp cham-\\nber are similar to the external morphology of the \\ntooth. On incisors and canines, you can remove \\neither the facial or lingual side from some teeth to \\nview the mesiodistal plane (as seen in Fig. 8-4A and E)\\nand remove the mesial or distal side from others to \\nview the faciolingual plane (as seen in Fig. 8-4B–D). \\nOn premolars and molars, the removal of either the \\nmesial or distal side will expose the outline of the \\nroof of the pulp chamber where pulp horns can be \\nseen extending beneath the cusps (as seen in premo-\\nlars in Fig. 8-4C and D). When the buccal or lingual \\nsides are removed to the level of the buccal and \\nlingual cusp tips, pulp cavities can be seen in a mesi-\\nodistal plane (as seen in Fig. 8-4E), the view similar \\nto that seen on a dental radiograph.

PULP SHAPE IN PREMOLARS\\na. Pulp Chambers and Pulp Horns in Premolars\\nWhen premolars are cut mesiodistally and viewed from \\nthe facial (or lingual) similar to the view on dental \\nradiographs (Fig. 8-8A), the occlusal border or roof of \\nthe pulp chamber is curved beneath the cusp similarly \\nto the curvature of the occlusal surface. When cut bucco-\\nlingually and viewed from the proximal, the pulp cham-\\nber often has the general outline of the tooth surface, \\nsometimes including a constriction near or apical to the \\ncervix (seen in Fig. 8-8C). The pulp horns on the roof \\nare visible beneath each cusp, and their relative lengths \\nare similar to the relative heights of the cusps. Thus, \\nthe buccal horns are longer than the lingual horns.\\nIn general, premolars have one pulp horn per func-\\ntional cusp. Therefore, the premolars that are the two-\\ncusp type most often have two pulp horns (Fig. 8-4C), \\nbut mandibular second premolars that are the three-cusp \\ntype have three pulp horns, and the mandibular first pre-\\nmolars that have a functionless lingual cusp may have \\nonly one pulp horn (Fig. 8-4D), similar to a canine.\\nb. Root Canal(s) and Orifices of Premolars\\nMaxillary first premolars  most often have two roots \\n(one buccal and one lingual) and two canals (one in \\neach root as seen in Fig. 8-8B). Even maxillary first pre-\\nmolars with a single root almost always have two canals. \\nFIGURE 8-5. Maxillary central incisors sectioned mesiodistally.\\nA.

Root Canal(s) and Orifices of Molars\\nMaxillary first molars most frequently have three roots \\n(mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and palatal), but four canals: \\none each in the distobuccal and palatal root, and two in \\nthe mesiobuccal root. In the palatal root, a single canal is \\nlarger and more easily accessible from the floor of the \\npulp chamber than for the other two roots,\\nG but this \\nroot and its canal often curve toward the buccal in the \\napical third, requiring skillful procedures to clean and \\ntreat it. On maxillary first molars, there are therefore \\nfour orifices on the floor of the pulp chamber: one for \\neach canal ( Fig. 8-13). Maxillary second molars , like \\nmaxillary first molars, most frequently have three roots \\nand four canals. The mesiobuccal root usually has two\\ncanals.\\nH The distobuccal and palatal roots each have \\none canal. The location of the orifices in the maxillary \\nsecond molar is similar to the maxillary first molar, \\nexcept that they are closer together (Fig. 8-9).\\nBoth mandibular first and second molars most fre-\\nquently have two roots (mesial and distal) and three\\ncanals. The wider mesial roots most often have two\\ncanals: mesiobuccal and mesiolingual. I The narrower \\ndistal roots most often have only one canal.J The roof of \\nthe pulp chamber is often at the same level as the cervical \\nborder of the enamel, with only the pulp horns extend-\\ning into the anatomic crown (Fig. 8-12). Most of the pulp \\nchamber is located within the root trunk. Location of the \\norifices of mandibular molars is shown in Figure 8-9.\\nK\\nMaxillary third molars usually have three root canals, \\nand mandibular third molars usually have two. However, \\nthey do vary considerably in root form. Third molars \\nare 9 to 11 years younger biologically than first molars, \\ncompleting their development later in life than first and \\nsecond molars. Therefore, on radiographs (x-ray films), \\ntheir pulp chambers and root canals are generally larger \\nthan in the other molars in the same mouth, especially \\nfor persons between the ages of 15 and 35 years.\\nRefer to T able 8-2 for a summary of the number of \\nroot canals related to the number of roots normally \\nfound within different tooth types.\\n4.

As teeth get older, the pulp chamber \\nbecomes smaller and is more apically located because \\nof deposits of secondary (additional) dentin produced \\nby specialized cells called odontoblasts lining the pulp \\nchamber. Dentin formation normally continues as long \\nas the pulp is intact or vital. That is, as dentin forms \\non the walls of the pulp cavity, the dentin gets thicker \\nmaking the pulp chamber smaller. The floor of the pulp \\nchamber in molars is nearly flat in young teeth, but later \\nbecomes more convex.\\nL In some cases, the pulp cham-\\nber may become entirely filled. This reduction in size \\nmakes finding and accessing the pulp chamber more \\ndifficult in an older patient than in the younger patient \\nwhere the teeth still have larger chambers.\\nTherefore, it is normal that the diameter of a root \\ncanal decreases in size with age, getting small in older \\nteeth because of the gradual addition of dentin on the \\ninternal walls. On the other hand, teeth (other than \\nthird molars) that exhibit unusually large pulp cham-\\nbers on dental radiographs are immediately suspected \\nof having necrotic pulps, that is, pulps that no longer \\nhave vital nerve or blood supply. Without vital pulp tis-\\nsue, dentin formation ceases, and the pulp chamber size \\nremains constant (once the pulp died) rather than con-\\ntinuing to decrease in size as is normal for vital teeth. \\nNecrotic pulps can be a possible source of infection.\\nWhen the tooth is subjected to attrition (wear), \\ntrauma, or tooth decay, or when a dental material called \\ncalcium hydroxide  is applied on the pulp, additional \\ndentin forms even more quickly and in greater quan-\\ntity. A pulp cap is a term describing a procedure where \\nthe dentist places calcium hydroxide on very thin den-\\ntin that covers the pulp (an indirect pulp cap), or over \\na small bit of exposed healthy pulp (a direct pulp cap)\\nin order to stimulate the formation of a new layer of \\ndentin to help the tooth heal.\\nD. CLINICAL APPLICATION OF PULP \\nMORPHOLOGY RELATED TO \\nRESTORATIVE DENTISTRY\\nThe dentist’s knowledge of normal pulp shape, size, and \\ndepth beneath the enamel is important to him or her \\nwhen preparing teeth that have deep decay . When the \\ndentist determines that the tooth can be restored without \\nthe need to remove the pulp, he or she must prepare the \\ntooth in such a way to avoid disturbing or injuring the \\npulpal tissues. Whenever possible, the goal is to leave \\nsome sound (undecayed) dentin on the floor of the cav-\\nity preparation to provide support for the restoration \\n(such as a filling using composite resin or amalgam) \\nand to avoid exposing any part of the pulp cavity with \\na cutting bur or hand instrument. This is accomplished \\nthrough knowledge of the shape of the pulp chamber \\nand canals and a careful evaluation of the patient’s \\nradiographs to determine the location of the pulp \\nrelative to the decay and external surface of the tooth. \\nAn example of deep decay that has reached the pulp \\nis seen in Figure 8-14 . Also, the dentist must avoid \\nTable 8-2 MOST COMMON NUMBERS OF ROOTS AND CANALS IN ADULT TEETH\\nTOOTH NAME NO. OF ROOTS NO.

CLINICAL APPLICATION \\nOF PULP MORPHOLOGY RELATED \\nTO ENDODONTICS\\n1. ENDODONTICS DEFINED\\nEndodontics is a specialty branch of dentistry con-\\ncerned with the morphology, physiology, and pathol-\\nogy of human dental pulp and periapical tissues. Its \\nstudy and practice encompass the related basic and \\nclinical sciences, including biology of the normal pulp; \\nthe cause (etiology), diagnosis, prevention, and treat-\\nment of diseases and injuries of the pulp; and resultant \\npathologic conditions that occur around the root.\\nAn endodontist is a dentist who specializes in endo-\\ndontics (root canal therapy). An endodontist is specially \\ntrained to provide root canal therapy, including treating \\npatients with more difficult and complex endodontic \\nsituations who may be referred from a general dentist. \\nTreatment may involve difficult root canal anatomy, \\nmedically compromised patients, and/or surgical treat-\\nments of periapical pathosis and infection.\\n2. DIAGNOSIS OF PULPAL \\nAND PERIAPICAL DISEASE\\nIrreversible pulpitis  (inflammation of the pulp that \\ncannot be healed) is a condition of the pulp tissue \\nwhere the pulp will not heal and root canal treatment is \\nindicated. Teeth with irreversible pulpitis are unusually \\nsensitive to cold or hot, and sometimes either stimulus \\nmay cause an exaggerated response and prolonged pain.\\nThe patient may also experience spontaneous pain in \\nthe tooth (i.e., pain felt without provocation of stimuli \\nsuch as heavy chewing, or exposure to hot or cold). The \\nusual cause of irreversible pulpitis is deep caries [CARE \\neez] (decay), although deep or poorly adapted restora-\\ntions may also contribute. The proximity of caries to \\nthe pulp can often be evaluated best using dental radio-\\ngraphs (Fig. 8-14). As the caries approaches the pulp, \\na normal defense reaction will occur involving inflam-\\nmation and eventually the formation of additional den-\\ntin called reparative dentin. However, when the caries \\nreaches or exposes the pulp, bacteria can overwhelm \\nthe defenses, and the tooth usually becomes painful. \\nThis prompts the patient to seek emergency dental \\ntreatment. Access to and removal of affected pulp tissue \\nwill provide relief from the pain. The pulp tissue can-\\nnot be successfully treated with medications alone once \\nthe pulp is irreversibly damaged.\\nPeriapical disease  occurs when the pulp has died \\n(has become necrotic). When the disease process in the \\nFIGURE 8-14. Dental decay (caries) reaches \\nthe pulp.

Once the bacteria and prod-\\nucts of pulpal breakdown contained within the root \\ncanals reach the apical foramen, the periapical tissue \\nbeyond the apical foramen will begin to react to this \\ninsult. A chronic inflammatory response in the bone \\ncan lead to the formation of a granuloma (i.e., a mass of \\nchronic inflammatory tissue enclosed within a fibrous \\ncapsule). Since a granuloma is less dense than bone, \\na radiograph will usually reveal radiolucency (a peria-\\npical radiolucency is the dark area at end of the root; \\nFig. 8-15 ). In some cases, the granuloma undergoes \\ndegeneration and a cyst is formed. A cyst is an epithe-\\nlium-lined sac filled with liquid or semiliquid material. \\nThe difference between a granuloma and a cyst cannot \\nbe determined on a radiograph. When the bacteria from \\nthe root canal overwhelm the defenses of the periapical \\ntissues or the patient’s immune system is compromised, \\nbacteria invade through the bone to the surrounding \\nsoft tissue, resulting in facial swelling and/or severe \\npain. Cleaning the root canals and draining the area of \\ninfection will usually provide relief within two to three \\ndays.\\nAnother result of pulpal trauma (like being hit in \\nthe mouth with a baseball) is the discoloration of the \\ntooth crown to a gray or brownish color, which indi-\\ncates damage to the pulp and the need to evaluate the \\ntooth for possible endodontic treatment. After the root \\ncanal, the discoloration can be greatly reduced by using \\nan intracoronal bleaching technique where the bleach \\nis placed within the pulp chamber for a period of time. \\nSee the change of tooth color in Figure 8-16.\\n3.

On anterior teeth, the opening is made \\non the lingual surface and on posterior teeth through \\nthe occlusal surface. These access openings vary con-\\nsiderably from cavity preparations used in operative \\ndentistry.

Knowledge of the number of root canals \\npresent in teeth is critically important to successful \\nendodontic treatment.

When the canal orifices\\nhave been located, endodontic files are used to remove \\nthe diseased pulp tissue and to begin cleaning the \\ncanals. In order to approximate the file length, the \\nlengths of the corresponding root and crown are mea-\\nsured using a preoperative radiograph. Then, with the \\nfiles carefully inserted into the root canals, a radiograph \\nis made with the files in the root ( Fig. 8-17).

These pre-\\nmature contacts could also be called deflective occlusal \\ncontacts if, upon closing in a  posterior position, the \\nteeth do not close directly into best or tightest fit but \\ninstead hit the prematurity, which deflects the mandible \\n(changes direction of the mandible) before it can reach \\nits tightest fit. This closure is different than the way the \\nrelaxed chewing muscles and anatomy of the jaw joint \\nwould guide the jaws together if there were no teeth. \\nThis could eventually contribute to the wearing away \\nof enamel forming a facet [FAS it] or flat spot, clearly \\nevident on the occlusal surfaces of the mandibular pre-\\nmolars and first molar in Figure 9-7. Under certain cir-\\ncumstances, this imbalance can cause muscle pain.\\nC. CLASS II MALOCCLUSION\\nA class II relationship (or disto-occlusion) is a skeletal \\ntype of malocclusion where the mandibular teeth are \\nin a distal (or posterior) relationship with their normal \\nmaxillary opponents (Fig. 9-12A). A person with class II \\nocclusion may have a mandible that is too small, maxil-\\nlae that are too large, or both. The result is a mandible \\nthat appears behind (retruded from) where it should \\nnormally be located. That is, the mandible is in disto-\\nocclusion, and the person has a receded chin. This pro-\\nfile (with a retruded mandible) is convex and is called \\nretrognathic [ret rog NATH ik] (Fig. 9-12D).\\nIn a person with class II occlusion, the mesiobuc-\\ncal groove of the mandibular first molar is distal to\\nthe mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar by a \\ndistance at least the width of a premolar (Fig. 9-12A \\nand B). That is, the mandible is distal to where it is \\nlocated in a person with class I occlusion. If the align-\\nment differs by less distance than the width of a pre-\\nmolar, it is called a tendency toward class II occlusion. \\nThere are two subdivisions of this type of skeletal mal-\\nocclusion based on the inclination and overlap of the \\nmaxillary incisors. They are known as division 1 and \\ndivision 2 (as seen in Fig. 9-12C).\\nFIGURE 9-10. Three types of anterior tooth relationships. \\nA. Severe overbite with maxillary incisors completely overlap-\\nping (covering up) the mandibular incisors.

In order to understand how this complex \\njoint works, you first need to understand how the jaw \\njoint is put together.\\nA. ANATOMY OF THE \\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT\\nThis introduction to the anatomy of the jaw joint is \\nbrief. A more complete discussion of this joint relative \\nto the other structures of the skull (other bones plus \\nmuscles, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels) can be \\nfound in Chapter 14.\\nA joint, or articulation, is a connection between \\ntwo separate parts of the skeleton. The temporoman-\\ndibular joint  or TMJ (or craniomandibular articula-\\ntion\\n2) is the articulation between the mandible and the \\ntwo bones on the base of the skull called the temporal\\nbones. This joint is the only visible, free-moving artic-\\nulation in the head. All other bones of the skull are \\nconnected by sutures and are immovable.\\n3 The TMJ is \\na bilateral articulation, that is, the right and left sides \\nwork as a unit. There are three parts to each half  of \\nthe TMJ: the process of the mandible called the man-\\ndibular condyle [KON dile], the shallow concavity on \\nthe base of the skull in the temporal bone called the \\narticular (glenoid) fossa  with its adjacent articular \\neminence (ridge), and the articular disc  interposed \\nbetween these two bony parts ( Fig. 9-15). These three \\nparts are enclosed by a fibrous connective tissue \\ncapsule.\\n3–5\\n1. MANDIBULAR CONDYLE\\nThe horizontal portion of the mandible that contains \\nthe teeth is called the body of the mandible. There are \\ntwo broad vertical parts on each side of the body called \\nrami [RAY my] (singular is ramus). The mandibular\\ncondyles are the most superior processes of the rami \\nand are rounded from front to back and from side to side \\n(Fig. 9-15). The rounded end ( head) of each condyle \\nfits into a concave fossa on the base of the skull called \\nan articular fossa (seen on the skull in Fig. 9-16).\\n2. ARTICULAR FOSSA AND ARTICULAR \\nEMINENCE\\nStudy the right side of Figure 9-16 where half of the \\nmandible has been removed, exposing the maxillary \\nteeth and the articular fossa and eminence. A trans-\\nverse bony ridge called the articular eminence forms \\nthe anterior border of the articular fossa (Fig. 9-15). \\nThe fossa is considered to be a nonfunctioning portion \\nof the joint because, when the teeth are in tight occlu-\\nsion, there is no forceful contact between the head of \\nthe condyle and the concave part of the articular fossa. \\nIn the photograph of a sectioned TMJ viewed under \\nmagnification in Figure 9-17, the head of a condyle is \\nin the position it would occupy when the teeth come'),\n",

The \\nfunctional region of each condyle and eminence is pad-\\nded with a thick layer of tough fibrous tissue, an area \\nthat has no blood vessels or nerves.\\n6 This fibrous tissue\\nis particularly thick on the surfaces where function \\noccurs: between the superior and anterior surfaces of the \\ncondyle and the posterior surface of the articular emi-\\nnence. This contact is only indirect, however, since an \\narticular disc is normally interposed between the two \\nfunctioning bony elements.\\n3. ARTICULAR DISC\\nExamine a skull with the posterior teeth fitting together \\n(in tight occlusion) and study how the mandibular con-\\ndyle fits loosely into the articular fossa. There should be \\na visible space between the mandibular condyle and the \\narticular fossa that in life was occupied by the articular\\ndisc. The disc is not present in a prepared dry skull \\nbecause the disc is not bone. The disc ( Fig. 9-18) is a \\ntough pad of dense fibrous connective tissue that acts \\nas a shock absorber between the mandibular condyle, \\nand the articular fossa and articular eminence. It sta-\\nbilizes the condyle by filling the space between the dif-\\nferent contours of the condyle, and the articular fossa \\nand articular eminence.\\n7 The disc also acts as a cushion \\nbetween the bones at the point of contact (like a shock \\nabsorber).\\nThe articular disc divides the space between the head \\nof the condyle and the articular fossa into upper and \\nlower joint spaces  (upper and lower synovial cavities \\nseen in Fig. 9-18), which permit complex functional \\nmovements of the mandible.\\n7 When the mandible \\nmoves during function, the right and left discs normally \\nmove at the same time because the muscles that pull \\nthe jaw forward are attached to the mandibular con-\\ndyles as well as to the discs. Proprioceptive [PRO pri o \\nSEP tiv] fibers in the disc help regulate movements of \\nthe condyle by unconsciously determining the position \\nof the mandible.\\n4.

The \\nseat of the swing, like the body of the mandible, moves \\nquite a bit, whereas the highest chain links (like the \\nheads of the condyles) move little since they are at the \\naxis of rotation. This purely rotational movement is \\npossible only when opening the mandible up to about \\nhalf way.\\nG Further, the rotation of the mandible around \\nthis hinge axis is possible only when the mandible is \\nnot being pulled forward.\\nC. MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE UPPER \\nJOINT SPACE\\nMovement between the superior surfaces of the discs \\nand the articular fossa (and eminence) occurs within \\nthe upper joint spaces. When you open and close the \\nmouth beyond about half way (i.e., beyond the limit of \\nthe purely hinge-like movement), the mandibular con-\\ndyles and discs together translate or glide forward (when \\nopening) and backward (when closing). Translation is \\nthe bodily movement of the entire mandible (and discs) \\ndownward and forward onto the articular eminences. \\nDuring translation, the horizontal axis between the \\ncondyles actually moves forward as the condyles and \\ndiscs slide from the articular fossae over the adjacent \\neminences. Think of this translatory movement as tak-\\ning the entire playground swing set with its horizontal \\nbar (rotational axis) in the previous example and mov-\\ning it forward, which moves the swing (condyles and \\nbody of the mandible) bodily forward. If the swing is \\nstill swinging, a hinge movement is now combined with \\ntranslation, similar to most movements within the jaw .\\nWhen the condyles and discs do not move for-\\nward simultaneously, the result may be crepitation. \\nCrepitation (crepitus) is the crackling or snapping \\nsound or noise emitted from the TMJ because of a dis-\\nharmonious movement of the mandibular condyles \\nagainst the articular discs, sometimes erroneously \\nthought to be caused by the rubbing together of the \\ndry synovial surfaces of joints. When the crackling \\nnoise is heard, the articular disc may be snapping in or \\nout of position or it may become locked in the wrong \\nposition.\\n1,8–12,H Crepitation is not a rare occurrence \\nand does not normally require treatment unless it is \\naccompanied by pain, limited jaw opening, or trismus\\n[TRIZ mus] (i.e., a spasm of chewing muscles associ-\\nated with difficulty opening or locking of the jaw).\\n10,13\\nThe noise may disappear with time, or it may persist \\nfor many years being no more than a noisy annoyance. \\nWith practice, if a person who has crepitus on one or \\nboth sides can learn to open the jaw like a hinge with-\\nout protruding it forward, the condyles will be able to \\nrotate beneath the discs and the noise will stop.\\nBoth translatory and rotational opening movement \\noccur when a person continues opening beyond about \\nhalfway, beginning when the jaw exceeds the maxi-\\nmum hinge opening limit, and continuing until the jaw \\nis opened all of the way (Fig. 9-20).\\nFIGURE 9-20.

Several terms describing different tooth and \\njaw relations are discussed in this section.\\nA. MAXIMAL INTERCUSPAL POSITION\\nMaximum intercuspal position (MIP)  is a tooth-to-\\ntooth relationship that is not dependent on where the \\njaw muscles or joint anatomy would like to position the \\nmandible. It is the tightest or best fit between maxil-\\nlary and mandibular posterior teeth and can be demon-\\nstrated on handheld casts of the upper and lower arches \\nwithout looking into the mouth (Figs. 9-21B and 9-22B).\\nThis can also be called maximal intercuspation.\\nB. CENTRIC RELATION\\nCentric relation (CR)  or centric jaw relation  is an \\nimportant reproducible and repeatable relationship of \\nthe mandible to the maxillae because it is the relation-\\nship people return to each time they chew and swal-\\nlow, and it is the relationship that dentists use when \\nthey mount diagnostic casts of the mouth prior to \\nmajor restorative procedures. This jaw relationship is \\nnot affected by the presence (or absence) of teeth, so it \\ndoes not change due to tooth malocclusion. It includes \\nthe range of positions  of the mandible during a hinge-\\nlike opening and closing without moving bodily forward\\nand without teeth touching, or up until the first two \\nteeth initially just touch but do not yet begin to close \\nmore tightly into MIP.\\n18–20,J\\nIt is a relatively rare but ideal occurrence when CR \\ncoincides with the MIP. This occurs when the mandible\\nD. TOTAL JOINT MOVEMENT\\nNormal day-to-day functional mandibular movement\\nrequired for eating, swallowing, yawning, and talk-\\ning involves hinge-like rotation simultaneously with\\nsome translation of the mandible that occurs in both \\nthe upper and lower spaces of the TMJ. The combined \\nhinge and translatory motion follows a curved path pri-\\nmarily dictated by the movement of the condyle against \\nthe posterior and inferior surface of the articular emi-\\nnence because no conscious effort is being made to \\nopen in a retruded manner.\\n14,15\\nPoor occlusal relationships of any type can contrib-\\nute to a variety of joint problems.1,9–11,16,17,I\\nE. DISLOCATION OF THE MANDIBLE\\nWhen widely opening the mandible, the disc and head \\nof the condyle may move forward so far that they slip \\nout of the articular fossa and move forward beyond the \\narticular eminence. Thus, the mandible will be par-\\ntially dislocated ( luxation or condylar subluxation ).\\nThis dislocation occurs in the upper joint compart-\\nment where translation occurs. The mandibular con-\\ndyle can also come off of the disc, causing the jaw to \\nlock open. If the closing muscles suddenly contract, the \\nmandible could become painfully locked open . A per-\\nson’s jaw-opening muscles are not nearly as powerful \\nas the closing muscles, and therefore, we may not be \\nable to unlock a mandibular dislocation in our own \\nmouth without help. (Perhaps you have seen an alliga-\\ntor trainer hold the alligator’s jaws closed with only one \\nhand since their opening muscles are so weak.)\\nA subluxed position may be released when another \\nperson depresses the mandible with heavy force down-\\nward and backward to slip the mandibular condyles and \\ndiscs under the articular eminences and back into the \\narticular fossae. In order to avoid having the person \\nbite down on the fingers of the rescuer as the muscles \\nare released from their state of contraction, the rescuer’s \\nthumbs should be placed not on the mandibular teeth \\nbut bilaterally on the bony shelf (buccal shelf) of the \\nmandible just lateral to the molars. The disc is loosely \\nattached to the condyle and normally travels with it. \\nThere could be a lot of pain until the contracted mus-\\ncles relax after the mandible is depressed and reposi-\\ntioned by the thumbs of the rescuer.\\narticular eminences.

Most people have deflective malocclusion \\nto some degree. Premature or deflective occlusal con-\\ntacts refer to the teeth that are the first to contact as \\nthe mandible closes into its most retruded position in \\nCR. Deflective occlusal contacts guide or direct the \\nmandible away from where healthy muscles and joint \\nanatomy would comfortably guide the mandible if \\nthere were no teeth. Mandibular deviation  refers to \\nthe direction and movement of the mandible from the \\nfirst slight premature tooth contact with the jaw in CR \\nuntil the teeth reach their MIP. The direction of the \\ndeviation of the mandible is usually forward (about \\n1 to 2 mm) and upward, with or without simultane-\\nous lateral movement.\\n18,20,21,24,25 This is illustrated in \\nFigure 9-21 where premature contacts deflect the man-\\ndible forward and to the left as the teeth move from CR \\ninto MIP (from A to B), and in Figure 9-22, where the \\nmandible is deflected forward 2 mm (from A to B). In \\nFigure 9-22, compare the short vertical pencil lines on \\ntwo pairs of opposing maxillary and mandibular teeth \\nthat line up when the teeth are in their MIP but reveal \\nhow distally the mandible is positioned when in centric \\njaw relation. A prematurity is most obvious on the skull \\nin Figure 9-23 where the supraerupted maxillary third \\nmolar occludes before any other teeth when the man-\\ndible closes in its CR. This deflective occlusal contact \\nforces the mandible to move considerably forward and \\nsuperiorly in order to reach MIP.\\nEdentulous people (with no teeth) who wear \\ncomplete dentures or false teeth are provided with CR \\nthat coincides with MIP because they can learn to pull \\nthe mandible back and close into a stable and repeatable \\nposition of CR during jaw closure. This enables the tight \\nocclusion of denture teeth to coincide with the repeat-\\nable centric jaw position, so the dentures will remain \\ntightly secured against the mucosa and not rock loose \\nwhen functioning.\\nAn articulator is a mechanical device that holds \\ncasts of the two arches, permitting a close duplication \\nof the patient’s opening and closing centric jaw rela-\\ntions (Fig. 9-24). Notice the fit of the ball of the lower \\n(mandibular) part fitting into a concavity on the upper \\n(maxillary) part. This design simulates the heads of the \\ncondyles fitting into their articular fossae. It is easier \\nto study tooth relationships with the patient’s dental \\narches (dental stone casts) on the articulator in your \\nhands, rather than with your hands in the patient’s \\nmouth. What better way is there to determine whether \\nor not the maxillary and mandibular lingual cusps fit \\ntogether tightly or properly in the maximal intercuspal \\nrelationship?\\nFIGURE 9-23. Centric prematurity: initial contact of a \\nsupraerupted maxillary third molar. When the mandible is \\npositioned as it closes in centric relation, the first tooth to con-\\ntact in this dentition is the third molar. The mandible must then \\nshift forward and upward (arrows) in order for all teeth to come \\ntogether in the MIP.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nOpen your mouth so that your teeth are slightly\\napart, and close very slowly in a hinge motion \\nwithout sliding the jaw forward until the first teeth \\ninitially touch gently. The relationship of your jaws \\nprior to your first gentle tooth contacts is your \\ncentric jaw relation. The relation of this pure hinge \\nopening is a most important one to record when \\nmaking extensive dental restorations for a patient. \\nIf your mandible is deflected (hits and slides) for-\\nward as you continue to close your teeth together \\ninto their MIP where they fit together most tightly, \\nyou are experiencing deflective or premature \\nocclusal contacts, and you are among the major-\\nity of people whose CR does not coincide with \\nthe MIP. The mandible will almost always slide \\nforward from CR into MIP, either straight forward \\nor to one side. More than likely, your own deflec-\\ntive tooth contacts will not be as severe as that \\nshown in Figure 9-22. Can you determine in which \\ndirection your premature tooth contacts deflect \\nyour mandible? Compare the location of your \\nfirst (premature) tooth contact in CR with those \\nin Table 9-1.

Unless we are nervous, eating, talking, \\nyawning, or using our muscles to perform other less \\nnatural functions (such as playing a clarinet), the \\nmandible is in this comfortable resting position most \\nof the time (over 23 hours each day). When a person \\nwith an erect posture is totally relaxed and makes no \\nconscious effort to open or close the mouth so that \\nthe mandible is in its physiologic rest position, there \\nis a space between the occlusal surfaces of the maxil-\\nlary and mandibular teeth called the interocclusal rest \\nspace (or freeway space). This space is normally 2 to \\n4 mm between the maxillary and mandibular teeth. \\nOf course, when the teeth are missing (in an edentu-\\nlous person), there would be a much larger distance \\nbetween the residual toothless ridges when the man-\\ndible is resting.\\n27\\nA simple change in posture, such as looking up at \\nthe sky or stretching the neck back in the reclined den-\\ntal chair , will change the resting position of the jaw, \\npulling the mandible back and separating the teeth \\nfarther than when in a comfortable upright position \\n(Fig. 9-25). This change is due to the pull on the man-\\ndible by stretching skin and underlying tissue (fascia). \\nTherefore, when a dentist places a restoration (filling) \\nfor a patient who is reclined in the dental chair, a final \\nassessment and possible adjustment of the occlusion on \\nthis new restoration should take place with the patient \\nin a relaxed upright position.\\nD. JAW RELATIONSHIPS DURING \\nHORIZONTAL MOVEMENTS \\nOF THE MANDIBLE\\nRelationships between the mandible and the maxillae \\ncan be defined and documented as the mandible moves \\nhorizontally out of its centric relationship into other \\npositions. Eccentric jaw relationships  are any devia-\\ntion of the mandible from the CR position. These rela-\\ntionships occur when the lower jaw moves anteriorly \\n(protrusion), laterally (mandibular lateral translation \\nor excursion), or a combination of both.\\n1. PROTRUSIVE JAW RELATION \\nAND OCCLUSION\\nProtrusive movement occurs when the mandible moves \\nanteriorly (as when incising food between the ante-\\nrior teeth). Both mandibular condyles and discs move \\nforward together in their articular fossa, functioning \\nagainst and beneath the articular eminences whose \\nsloping morphology guides the mandible downward as \\nit moves forward. As protrusion occurs, the movement \\nof the mandible is also influenced by the amount of \\noverlap of the anterior teeth. When teeth are positioned \\nin MIP , upper incisors and canines overlap lower inci-\\nsors and canines ( Fig. 9-26 ). As stated earlier in this \\nchapter, this overlap can be described in terms of a hori-\\nzontal overlap where maxillary incisal edges are labial \\nto the mandibular incisal edges and a vertical overlap \\nFIGURE 9-25. Physiologic rest position: effects of posture. A. This man assumes a normal posture with his mandible in physi-\\nologic rest position (RP). Posterior teeth, though not visible, are not occluding. B.

LATERAL MANDIBULAR RELATION \\nAND OCCLUSION\\nDuring mandibular lateral translation , the mandible \\nmoves to the right or left side and slightly downward \\nas when chewing food. When the mandible moves to \\none side, both condyles do not move equally toward \\nthat side. Rather, when the mandible moves to the \\nright side, the right condyle rotates but remains rela-\\ntively stationary, while the left condyle and disc move \\nforward, downward, and medially within the articular \\nfossa. During maximum jaw movement, the mandible \\ncan move almost twice as far from side to side as it can \\ndirectly forward.\\nM\\nWhen the mandible moves laterally, the working\\nside is the side toward which the mandible moves dur-\\ning lateral excursion (seen in Fig. 9-29), and it is also \\nthe side where chewing (or work) occurs. The oppo-\\nsite side is called the nonworking side. These terms are \\ndependent upon which way the mandible is moved . For \\nexample, when the mandible moves to the right, the \\nright side is the working side and the left is the non-\\nworking, whereas when the mandible moves to the left, \\nthe left side is the working side and the right is the non-\\nworking side. The working side is the side where the \\n“work” of chewing occurs. As a person with an ideal \\nocclusal relationship moves the mandible laterally, the \\nridges of mandibular teeth on the working side  move \\nover the opposing maxillary ridges until maxillary buc-\\ncal cusps line up over mandibular buccal cusps, and \\nmaxillary lingual cups line up over mandibular lingual \\ncusps (seen in Fig. 9-29). The condyle on the working \\nside does not move much; it rotates on its vertical axis \\nand moves laterally only about 1 to 2 mm (called lat-\\nerotrusion or Bennett’s movement). When the working\\nside cusps are lined up end to end, the maxillary lingual\\ncusps of the nonworking side are aligned over the man-\\ndibular buccal cusps.\\nCanine-protected articulation  is the desirable\\nocclusal relationship in which the vertical overlap of \\nthe maxillary and mandibular canines produces a disoc-\\nclusion (separation) of all of the posterior teeth when \\nthe mandible moves to either side. Disocclusion refers \\nto the separation of opposing posterior teeth during \\neccentric movements of the mandible.\\n23,28 That is, when \\nthe person moves the mandible to the right (working) \\nside, there are no posterior tooth contacts evident on \\nthe working side (Fig. 9-29) and, although you can-\\nnot see this in the figure, there are also no nonworking\\nposterior tooth contacts due to the steep canine guid-\\nance on the right (working) side.

(See Ref. 31 for \\ninteresting information on this subject.)\\nFUNCTIONAL MOVEMENTS WHEN EATING: CHEWING \\nAND SWALLOWINGSECTION IV\\nFunctional movements are the normal movements of \\nthe mandible during speech, chewing, yawning, and \\nswallowing. Functional occlusion  refers to the tooth \\ncontacts that occur only during chewing and swal-\\nlowing. You may think that your teeth need to touch \\nwhen speaking, but go through the alphabet to see if \\nteeth need to touch for any sound. You will find that, \\nfor most persons, teeth do not actually touch, although \\nthey must come close during sounds like “sss.” since if \\nthe incisors are moved very far apart, the result is more \\nof an “sh” or whistling sound.\\nEating involves the intake of food by placing it in the \\nmouth, incising (bringing incisors together) to bite off \\na manageable size piece of food, chewing (also called \\nmastication [mas ti KA shun]), and swallowing (also \\ncalled deglutition [deg loo TISH un]). The follow-\\ning descriptions of incising, chewing, and swallowing \\napply to persons with ideal class I occlusion eating a \\npiece of chicken.\\nA. INCISING\\nIncising is the articulation of the anterior teeth per-\\nformed to cut food into chewable pieces. Eating begins \\nas the mandible drops downward to open the mouth, \\nand the mandible is protruded as food is placed between \\nthe opposing anterior teeth. The mandible then closes \\nin this protrusive position until the incisal edges of \\nthe anterior teeth meet the food. The mandible is then \\nmoved up and posteriorly with the mandibular incisors \\nagainst lingual surfaces of the maxillary incisors, thus \\ncutting off a small portion of the food.\\nB. MASTICATION (CHEWING)\\nNext, the tongue transfers food to the posterior teeth; \\nit is held in position on the teeth of the working side \\nby the cheek muscles and the action of the tongue. The \\nteeth are brought together, engaging the food with the \\nmandible in a slightly lateral position toward the work-\\ning side. The upper buccal cusps are directly over the \\nlower buccal cusps with the mandible in this lateral \\nposition. The closing motion slows as the mandible is \\nforcibly closed\\n32 while the canine overlap and inclines \\nof posterior tooth cusps guide the mandible into maxi-\\nmal intercuspation of the posterior teeth for chewing. \\nTooth cusp slopes and triangular ridges act as cut-\\nting blades, whereas major and supplemental grooves \\nserve as escape pathways (spillways or sluiceways) for \\ncrushed food to squeeze out through the buccal and lin-\\ngual embrasures and over the tooth curvatures toward \\nthe cheek and onto the tongue. There, it can be tasted, \\nmixed with saliva, placed back over the teeth, and \\nchewed some more. This process significantly reduces \\nlateral forces applied to the teeth that could be damag-\\ning to the teeth and their supporting bone. After the'),\n",

We usually chew like \\nthis on one side for several cycles and then switch the \\nfood over to the opposite side where a similar chewing \\ncycle occurs. This process is called mastication.\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nLook in a mirror and move your jaw as far as pos-\\nsible in all directions (wide open, and from right \\nto left) to discover exactly how wide and long your \\ntotal range of motion is. Then chew some sugarless \\ngum and notice that you use perhaps only half of \\nthis overall range of motion. Observe the pattern \\nof movement of your mandible from the facial view \\nduring chewing to see if you move your mandible \\nin a tear drop or circle shape similar to the pattern \\nof chewing. Your side or sagittal view could also be \\nviewed using a second mirror placed at 45°.\\nC. SWALLOWING (DEGLUTITION)\\nSwallowing begins as a voluntary muscular act (when \\nwe decide to) but is completed involuntarily by reflex \\naction. The mechanics are as follows:\\nThe anterior part of the mouth is sealed (lips •\\nclosed).\\nThe teeth are closed into their MIP.•\\nThe soft tissue in the back of the roof of the mouth •\\n(soft palate) is raised, so food cannot enter the nasal \\npassageway.\\nThe bone above the voice box (• hyoid bone) is raised \\nas we close off the trachea (windpipe). This prevents \\nfood from passing into the lungs.\\nThe posterior part of the tongue is engaged in a •\\npiston-like thrust causing the small mass of chewed \\nfood (bolus) to be pushed into the throat (oral \\npharynx [FAR inks]).\\nThe act of swallowing, also known as • deglutition,\\ntakes place.\\nOnce the bolus is in the pharynx, the superior por-•\\ntion of the posterior wall presses forward to seal the \\npharynx, and then the esophageal phase of swal-\\nlowing commences. This is accomplished by invol-\\nuntary peristalsis (waves of contraction), which \\nmoves the food bolus through the entire length of \\nthe digestive tract.\\nThen the mandible usually drops open, assuming its •\\nphysiologic resting posture where relaxed muscles \\npermit a slight space between upper and lower teeth. \\nSeveral swallows are necessary to empty the mouth \\nof a given food mass.

Some \\nforces between teeth are actually necessary for maintain-\\ning a healthy periodontium. Parafunctional contacts, on \\nthe other hand, are those tooth contacts that occur out-\\nside of these normal functions, like when teeth contact \\na hard object, or soft tissue, or other teeth. For example, \\ntooth-to-hard object contacts occur when smoking a pipe \\nif the smoker chews on the pipe stem, or when playing \\na reed instrument such as a clarinet, or when chewing \\non a pencil. Tooth-to-soft tissue contacts occur during \\ncheek biting or lip biting that can be confirmed dur-\\ning an oral examination as raw or thickened mucosa of \\nthe cheek or lip.

Bruxing can \\nbe particularly damaging to teeth and to the TMJ.\\nTooth contacts during parafunctional movements \\nmay be nothing more than an annoyance, but if these \\ncontacts involve considerable force and frequency beyond \\nwhich the tooth and muscles are able to withstand, they \\ncan be potentially damaging to teeth, to tooth support-\\nive structures, and to the TMJ. When a person develops \\na bruxing habit, these heavy and potentially damaging \\ntooth contacts may be exercised almost constantly under \\nstressful situations. In a healthy person without occlusal \\nproblems, functional tooth contacts including eating \\nthree meals will total only 7 to 8 minutes over a 24-hour \\nperiod. Parafunctional tooth contacts, in contrast, may \\noccur several hours per day or night. Also, biting strength \\nin bruxers or clenchers can be as much as six times higher \\nthan in the nonbruxers, so it takes little imagination to \\nunderstand why parafunctional habits like bruxing can \\nbe an undesirable and damaging habit.\\n14,S Bruxing can be \\nconfirmed by the noise it produces that can be heard by \\nothers and can result in sore chewing muscles. Bruxing \\nmay be worse if a person has malocclusions; anxiety or \\nstress; suppressed anger; or is hyperactive; uses caffeine, \\ntobacco, or drugs like cocaine and amphetamines. (See \\ngeneral reference for the Mayo Clinic.)\\nTeeth in heavy occlusion often exhibit flattened \\ntooth contours seen as tooth facets, or chipped enamel \\nand exposed dentin. These teeth may become sensi-\\ntive when chewing forcefully or when tapped on with \\na dental instrument, a condition known as sensitivity\\nto percussion. Heavy occlusion can also lead to tooth \\nmobility and loose teeth, possibly seen as fremitus .\\nFremitus [FREM i tus] is the palpable or visible vibra-\\ntion or movement of a tooth when subjected to heavy \\nocclusal forces. Fremitus is not necessarily an unhealthy \\ncondition but may be an indication of a premature CR \\ntooth contact or of interferences during sideways (lat-\\neral) movements of the mandible.\\nOn a radiograph, heavy occlusion on a tooth may \\ncontribute to a widened periodontal ligament or angu-\\nlar bone loss or loss of bone in the furcation (which \\ncould result in a loose tooth), thickened lining of the \\ntooth socket (lamina dura), and root resorption (i.e., \\nthe shortening of a root). In the presence of factors \\ncontributing to periodontal disease, heavy occlusion \\ncan worsen the disease process. Open proximal con-\\ntacts associated with malocclusions can contribute \\nto food impaction, gingivitis, and periodontitis if not \\nkept clean.\\nParafunctional contacts like bruxing can also nega-\\ntively impact on the ability to open and close the mouth \\ndue to tired muscles, or trismus (a disturbance of the \\ntrigeminal nerve resulting in spasms of the chewing \\nmuscles and limited jaw opening). Myofascial [my o \\nFASH i el] trigger points may result from overuse of the \\njaw muscles.\\n9,16 “Myofascial” refers to muscle and fascia,\\nwhich is the thin connective tissue covering that con-\\nnects muscles. Symptoms include tenderness and pain of \\nthe muscles of the face and head, and even the neck and \\nback. Other symptoms associated with heavy occlusion \\ninclude migraine-type headaches, sinus pain, and jaw \\njoint pain. The pain can sometimes be severe.\\n1,9,16,17,27,33,34\\nJoint pain  can result from heavy forces on pre-\\nmature or undesirable contacts, 27 but joint pain can \\nalso be due to disease, such as arthritis, or injury. \\nTemporomandibular disorders (TMDs) caused by ab -\\nnormal functioning of the TMJ can result from loss of \\nvertical dimension from tooth wear or tooth loss, loss \\nof posterior tooth support, or other malocclusions. \\nSymptoms of TMD include headaches, ringing of the \\nears (tinnitus [ti NI tis]), ear pain, and impaired hear-\\ning. Symptoms can be made worse when the force or \\nfrequency of clenching and grinding increases, as might \\noccur in persons under psychological stress, or in per-\\nsons with poor posture (e.g. those who frequently rest \\none side of their jaw on their hand).\\nSome tooth contacts are less desirable than others \\nbecause they are less capable of withstanding heavy \\nforces and more likely to result in an increase of muscle \\nor tooth pain. For example, signs and symptoms from \\nheavy occlusion are more likely when only two poste-\\nrior teeth occlude during heavy or repeated contacts. \\nCanines, on the other hand, are more capable of with-\\nstanding heavy occlusal forces, which is why canine-\\nprotected occlusion is desirable since posterior teeth \\nseparate during protrusive and lateral jaw movements. \\nAlso, tooth contacts on the nonworking side are not tol-\\nerated well, and heavy forces that are not along the ver-\\ntical axis of the tooth are more likely to be destructive.\\nFortunately, we have a natural mechanism that \\nhelps to protect teeth from heavy tooth contacts. Our \\nfifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve) provides nerve \\nbranches to the periodontal ligaments of each tooth \\n(especially canines), and these nerve fibers send mes-\\nsages to the brain from sensory end organs called pro-\\nprioceptors [PRO pree o SEP ters]. Therefore, tooth \\ncontacts direct movements of the muscles that move \\nthe mandible in order for us to avoid heavy traumatic \\nor deflective contacts.\\nR By virtue of this complex pro-\\ntective mechanism, traumatic or deflective tooth con-\\ntacts are most often avoided during normal functioning \\n(chewing, talking, and swallowing).\\n8,18–20,22'),\n",

PATIENT EDUCATION \\nAND BEHAVIOR THERAPY\\nIt is important to educate a person on self-treatments that \\nhelp alleviate muscle pain or tooth pain related to unde-\\nsirable or premature occlusion. To begin with, they need \\nto know that their pain may be due to their tooth grind-\\ning. Just knowing that clenching and bruxing may cause \\ntheir pain can help the patient to stop bruxing, at least \\nduring the day when they notice it. They need to know \\nthat keeping their teeth apart and resting the muscles for \\na while may help. It is better to eat foods that are easy to \\nchew (like pasta and soups), to avoid foods that require \\nconsiderable force to chew (like candy-coated peanuts \\nor taco chips), and to avoid foods that increase the fre-\\nquency of tooth contacts (like chewing gum). Also, limit \\nalcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, all of which may worsen \\nthe problem. They should be made aware that bad pos-\\nture might contribute to muscle pain in the neck and \\njaws. Biofeedback (from monitors charting muscle activ-\\nity) may also be helpful to provide patients with print-\\nouts that confirm when they are tightening their muscles \\nso that they can learn how to avoid these actions.\\nB. STRESS MANAGEMENT \\nAND MUSCLE RELAXATION\\nSince persons under psychological stress are more likely \\nto clench and brux more frequently or with more force, \\ntherapies that can reduce stress may help. Self-therapies \\ninclude yoga, meditation, deep breathing, and visualiza-\\ntion of a peaceful scene. Referral for psychological coun-\\nseling may also be necessary. The dentist may prescribe \\npain medications initially to reduce the pain, tranquil-\\nizers to help the patient relax, or muscle relaxants to \\nhelp reduce muscle tension, but side effects like drowsi-\\nness or dry mouth may be undesirable. Botulinum toxin \\n(Botox) has been shown to be helpful for some persons \\nwith severe bruxism who have not responded to other \\ntherapies.\\n36 New research has actually shown that tak-\\ning some antidepressant medications (like serotonin \\nspecific reuptake inhibitors) may have the side effect \\nof bruxing.\\n37 Therapies that help relieve muscle pain \\nelsewhere in the body could also be used to reduce pain \\nin the muscles of mastication, and these include apply-\\ning ice for several minutes followed by moist heat to \\nrelax muscles. Jaw muscle exercise may also be helpful \\nonce the muscle pain has been eliminated.\\nC. CHANGING JAW RELATIONSHIPS \\nWITH AN OCCLUSAL DEVICE\\nTo successfully correct a patient’s unfortunate parafunc-\\ntional bruxing habit is not an easy task and takes time, \\nskill, and patience at best. A basic principle of treating \\nocclusal dysfunction is to get the teeth to come together \\nevenly (without premature on undesirable contacts) \\nwhile the mandible is in its most comfortable position. \\nWhen a patient suffers from pain due to malocclusion, \\nthe use of an occlusal device like a bite plane should \\nbe considered, and extensive dental work (multiple \\nrestorations, bridges, equilibration, orthodontics, etc.) \\nshould be postponed until the patient has remained \\ncomfortable for several weeks, and upon return visits \\nrequires little or no adjustment of the device.\\nAn occlusal device (sometimes called a bite guard\\nor night guard) is a removable artificial occlusal sur-\\nface that can be used to stabilize occlusion, treat the \\npain from TMDs, or prevent tooth wear. A detailed \\ndescription of the method for constructing a maxillary \\nocclusal device is presented in Figure 9-30. This type \\nof occlusal device is constructed of a thin, horseshoe-\\nshaped layer of transparent plastic that fits over the \\nupper teeth to provide a smooth surface for the mandib-\\nular teeth to contact without a deflective prematurity. \\nA properly constructed occlusal device reduces deflec-\\ntion of the mandible by preventing the input to prop-\\nrioceptive sensors around the teeth that are in heavy \\nocclusion, thereby providing a noninvasive, reversible \\ntherapy.\\n1,8,18–20,22,38 Its use permits the mandible to close \\ninto a centric jaw relation, which is the most comfort-\\nable and stable position. Patients are advised to wear the \\nocclusal device 24 hours each day except when eating, \\nand the device should be periodically evaluated and \\nadjusted as needed. After a few days, the patient may \\nexperience tremendous relief from severe facial mus-\\ncle pain, headaches, or even some backaches that are \\nrelated to an imbalance of the TMJ and tooth occlu-\\nsion. For example, the patient in Figure 9-22 exhibited \\ntrismus and limited jaw opening over a 4-year period. \\nHe was only able to open 35 mm at the incisors, but \\nafter he wore a maxillary occlusal device for 18 months, \\nhis mandible stabilized into a comfortable CR position, \\nand he was able to open at the incisors 55 mm.\\nTREATMENT METHODS RELATED TO MALOCCLUSIONSECTION VI'),\n",

CHANGING TEETH SHAPES TO TREAT \\nSYMPTOMS OF MALOCCLUSION\\nOcclusal equilibration is the process by which a den-\\ntist modifies the occlusal or incisal form of the teeth by \\nusing revolving burs or stones in a dental handpiece to \\nremove very small amounts of enamel at the sites of the \\ntooth prematurities.\\n22 An occlusal equilibration should \\nnever be attempted without first having the patient \\nwear a maxillary occlusal device for 1 to 6 weeks, \\nwhich ensures natural and comfortable repositioning of \\nthe mandible and its TMJ. After equilibration, the teeth \\nshould be in harmony with physiologically relaxed \\njoints. The occlusal equilibration should be reevalu-\\nated at appropriate intervals to confirm the need for \\nfollow-up treatment.\\nAnother technique that can be used to perfect the \\ncontours and occlusion of teeth that are not too badly \\nout of alignment is to reconstruct the occluding surfaces \\nof all or most teeth by constructing large, stress-bearing \\nrestorations such as crowns or fixed partial dentures \\n(bridges). This technique is called a full-mouth reha-\\nbilitation where most teeth are restored with crowns \\nthat change and perfect the occlusion. An example of \\nthe stages of a full mouth rehabilitation performed dur-\\ning the 2000s is presented in Figure 9-31. This patient \\npresented to the dentist with a history of severe gastric \\n(acid) reflux, which contributed to erosion of lingual \\nenamel and much dentin on the lingual surfaces of \\nthe anterior teeth. He complained of tooth pain (due \\nto exposed dentinal tubules), muscle pain, and TMJ \\npain. He exhibited a deviation between CR and MIP of \\nabout 2 mm. After preliminary diagnostic procedures \\nwere completed, the decision was made to restore all \\nposterior teeth with crowns to correct the deviation, \\nand place all-ceramic crowns or lingual indirect com-\\nposite veneers to improve contours and cover exposed \\ndentin on all anterior teeth. Figure 9-31 shows the teeth \\nbefore, during, and after the full mouth rehabilitation. \\nAfter therapy, the patient reported no symptoms, and \\nesthetics was improved.\\nE. CHANGING TOOTH LOCATION \\nTO TREAT MALOCCLUSION\\nWhen teeth are so poorly aligned that the amount of \\ntooth structure to be removed during an equilibration \\nor a full mouth rehabilitation would result in exposure \\nof sensitive dentin or even exposure of pulpal tissue, \\nthe dentist needs to consider other treatment options. \\nOrthodontic treatment can be used to bodily move the \\nteeth into an improved alignment. Figure 9-22 shows \\nthe results of a severe unilateral molar prematurity in \\nthe centric relation position. This patient underwent \\nover 2 years of orthodontic therapy to correct the \\nenormous discrepancy between centric jaw relation \\nand MIP. Other alternatives would have been surgery \\n(intrusion of molars) or possibly root canal therapy \\non the molars followed by eight cast crowns (reduc-\\ning molar cusp height). Ordinarily, a centric relation \\nprematurity is not as severe as this and often can be \\ncorrected when necessary with minimal occlusal equili-\\nbrations or minor orthodontic tooth movement.\\nTreatment of class II and class III malocclusions \\nusing orthodontics (including braces) usually requires \\nmuch longer correction time and often involves surgical \\nintervention compared to treatment of class I malocclu-\\nsions. This is due to the greater disparity from an ideal \\nFIGURE 9-31. Stages of a full mouth rehabilitation. A.

ENVELOPE OF MOTION\\nA helpful method for analyzing a patient’s mandibular \\nmovement is to obtain an outline of their jaw movement \\ncalled an envelope of motion. This is done by attaching \\na marking device (stylus) to the mandibular teeth that \\ncan trace on paper the movements of the mandible as \\nviewed from the front (a frontal view) or from the side \\n(a sagittal view). Figure 9-33 shows examples of these \\ntwo tracings, both reproducing the outer border move-\\nments during maximal movement of the mandible. \\nWhen facing a person, the frontal envelope is the out-\\nline formed (traced) by a marker located between the \\nmandibular central incisors while the mandible moves \\nmaximally in all directions. Beginning with teeth in their \\nmost intercuspal position (MIP), the mandible (with \\nteeth lightly touching) moves the maximum distance \\nrelationship of the corresponding teeth in the maxillae \\nand mandible. When the jaws are so poorly aligned or \\nso different in size that it is impossible to perfect tooth \\ncontour using only restorations or orthodontics, surgi-\\ncal techniques can be used to reshape and realign jaw \\nbones, usually followed by orthodontic treatment to \\nperfect tooth alignment. Orthognathic surgery [or thog \\nNATH ik] is the surgical reshaping of the jawbones and \\nmay be used in conjunction with orthodontics to cor-\\nrect severe class II and class III skeletal malocclusions. \\nThis technique dramatically and quickly improves \\nappearance; provides better tooth relationships; and \\neventually, better function as well. The change in pro-\\nfile and occlusion from this surgery can clearly be seen \\nin Figure 9-32.\\nFIGURE 9-32. Comparison of jaw alignment before and after orthognathic surgery. A.

The \\nmandible with the teeth in light contact first slides lat-\\nerally to the patient’s left (our right) as far as possible. \\nThe outline reveals the amount of canine overlap result-\\ning in the mandible initially moving down as it moves \\nto the side until the canines are end to end, and then \\nmoves upward as the canines move laterally beyond \\ntheir end-to-end alignment. Next, the jaw opens down-\\nward in its most left lateral position until open about \\n30 mm, then begins veering toward the center to a \\nmaximum opening of 51 mm. From this point, the jaw \\nmoves to the patient’s right (our left) as far as possible \\nas it begins to close. Finally, from the closed maximum \\nright side position, the teeth slide into MIP as the jaw \\nslowly moves back and upward (due to the canine over-\\nlap) into the starting point (MIP).\\nThe sagittal envelope can be visualized, when view-\\ning a person from the side, as an outline formed (traced) \\nby a dot located between the mandibular central inci-\\nsors while the mandible begins in the centric relation \\n(CR) position, just before the teeth move forward into \\nthe MIP. Next, with teeth lightly together, the mandible \\nmoves into its most anterior (protruded) position, then \\nto its most open position, and from there the mandible \\ncloses in its most posterior position into CR until teeth \\nlightly touch. Finally, the mandible returns (with teeth \\nlightly touching) to the MIP. To analyze the tracing of \\na sagittal envelope of motion in Figure 9-33B, begin \\nat the centric relation or CR. Due to a slight deflective \\n(premature) contact, the mandible is directed forward \\nand slightly upward into the MIP. With the teeth held \\ntogether lightly as the mandible continues to protrude \\nmaximally, the initial downward movement of the man-\\ndible is due to incisal overlap (normal overbite) where \\nthe lingual surfaces of maxillary incisors guide the \\nmandible downward as it goes forward, followed by an \\nupward and forward movement as mandibular incisors \\nmove beyond the edge-to-edge position into the most \\nprotruded position. With the mandible protruded, it \\nmoves down to the maximum opening of 51 mm. From \\nthis point, the jaw closes while firmly retruded, which \\ndevelops the curved translation portion of closure, fol-\\nlowed by the straighter hinge-opening boundary (with \\nrotary motion only), and finally back to the starting \\npoint (MIP). We can tell from this envelope of motion \\nthat upon opening, this person can rotate his retruded \\nmandible open 30 mm at the incisors with a hinge \\nmovement before it begins to translate forward.\\nNow, study Figure 9-34 to compare the uppermost \\nportions of the frontal envelopes of motion of three \\nsubjects in order to visualize differences in the supe-\\nrior portion related to the amount of canine guidance \\n(overlap).

The chew-\\ning cycles occupy only 25 mm of the maximum 51 mm \\nopening range for this man. The chewing strokes on \\npeanuts in a lateral direction utilize only 12 mm of the \\ntotal side-to-side range of mandibular movement.\\nOn the sagittal view (Fig. 9-33B), note that the chew-\\ning stroke begins at the MIP and that the opening stroke \\nis more posterior than the closing stroke. The open-\\ning stroke is only 7 mm anterior to the hinge-opening \\nboundary, whereas the closing stroke is 10 mm ante-\\nrior to that boundary. However, as the jaws are closed \\nto crush the food bolus, the mandible is slightly more \\nretruded than the MIP. Crushing of the food bolus (a \\nrounded mass of food) occurs at this MIP.\\nB.

Then the entire \\nassembly is carried to the mouth (Fig. 9-35E), and the \\npatient closes firmly, as previously, onto the leaf gauge \\nuntil the recording medium sets. The imprints of the \\nupper and lower teeth in this centric relation registra-\\ntion (Fig. 9-35F) are used to relate casts of each arch \\nmounted on the articulator (Fig. 9-35G). This diagnos-\\ntic mounting procedure should always be accomplished \\nprior to attempting any type of tooth equilibration in \\nthe mouth.\\n18,19,22 These dental stone casts, mounted in \\ntheir relaxed centric relation position, can be used to \\ndetermine the extent of tooth reshaping required in \\norder to decide the best treatment. The dental stone \\nteeth with interfering or premature contacts can be \\nreshaped (reduced) in order to predict the amount of \\ntooth reduction that will be required during the equili-\\nbration. If the amount of tooth structure that must be \\nremoved during the equilibration would likely expose \\ndentin or pulp, then orthodontics or surgical proce-\\ndures must be considered.\\nAnother device used for anterior deprogramming \\nof the mandible and for recording centric jaw relation \\nis the sliding guiding inclined gauge or sliding guide\\n40–44\\n(Fig. 9-36 ). It comes in three maximum thicknesses, \\nand the thickness used is dependent on the severity of \\nthe malocclusion (Fig. 9-36A). The thickness gradually \\nincreases from tip to handle, and the curvature of the \\nsliding guide is critical, so that it can be placed in the \\nmouth between overlapping incisors at a relatively steep \\nangle relative to the plane of occlusal without injuring \\nthe tissue of the roof of the mouth (Fig. 9-36B). The \\nexact thickness between the incisors is read on the mil-\\nlimeter scale (Fig. 9-36C). Minimal incisal separation \\nis the goal for deprogramming and jaw position regis-\\ntration, just so long as no posterior teeth touch, thus \\navoiding proprioceptive impulses. This is particularly \\nimportant for the centric jaw relation registration to \\nminimize errors between the articulator and the patient. \\nThe sliding guide is made of a non-brittle autoclavable \\nplastic and works well with a custom bite deformed \\nWoelfel leaf wafer for centric relation jaw registrations \\n(Fig. 9-36D and E).\\n40–43\\nC. LONG CENTRIC ARTICULATION\\nLong centric articulation  or the intercuspal contact \\narea is actually a range of mandibular movement where \\na person can smoothly (without interferences) move \\nthe mandible from centric relation directly forward in a \\nhorizontal plane to the position of maximum intercus-\\npation. There is no upward or lateral component. This \\nrange of movement is often the goal during an equili-\\nbration to provide the patient with a long centric rela-\\ntionship by relieving all deflective or premature tooth \\ncontacts that had previously caused the mandible to \\ndeviate either sideways or upward from centric relation \\nto the MIP. The patient with a long centric articulation \\nwill have a small anteroposterior range (0.5 to 2.0 mm) \\nof uniform posterior tooth contact occurring at the \\nsame vertical dimension of occlusion.\\nFIGURE 9-36.

The millimeter scales denote \\nthe amount of incisal separation between overlapping incisors (left sliding guide 16 mm, center one 9 mm, right one 4 mm). \\nB. A 4-mm sliding guide is held between the incisors at a steep angle to the occlusal plane separating them by 2.5 mm, just enough to \\nkeep all of the posterior teeth from touching. C.

Also, place vertical \\nlines to denote the midline of both arches (Fig. A).\\nA\\n3. Sketch (very lightly) the right maxillary and \\nmandibular central incisors. View the anterior \\nteeth from the facial view with the midlines \\nlined up. The mesial surfaces of each tooth \\nshould touch the midline, the incisal edge \\nshould touch the parallel horizontal lines, and \\nthe maxillary central should be wider than the \\nmandibular incisor.\\n4. Next, sketch (very lightly) the relative shape and \\nwidth of each incisal edge or cusp in the maxillary \\narch using the top horizontal line as a guide for \\nplacing the incisal and occlusal surfaces. Note that \\nthe models or typodonts must be rotated when \\nviewing more posterior teeth so that each tooth \\nis viewed directly from the facial. Recall that the \\nmaxillary lateral incisor is narrower than the cen-\\ntral, but the canine and two premolar cusps are \\nabout equal in width (except the canine is often \\nslightly longer [beyond the horizontal line]). The \\nfirst and second molars each have two facial cusps \\nof approximately the same width, neither of which \\nis as wide as the premolars or canine (Fig. B).\\nB\\n5. Now sketch (lightly) the incisal edge or cusp \\nof each tooth in the mandibular arch. Try to \\ncorrectly align mandibular cusps relative to \\nmaxillary cusps. For example, the cusp tip of the \\nmandibular canine is aligned with the embra-\\nsure between the maxillary lateral incisor and \\nthe canine, the cusp tip of the mandibular first \\npremolar is aligned with the embrasure between \\nthe maxillary canine and first premolar, and so \\nforth. Recall that the mandibular first molar \\nmost often has three buccal cusps; keep the \\ndistal cusp quite small in order to maintain \\nthe proper alignment between arches. Begin \\nto form the occlusal/incisal embrasure spaces \\nby rounding the mesial and distal “corners” of \\neach tooth (more so for posterior teeth).\\n6. Sketch (very lightly) the proximal and cervical \\ncontours of each tooth. Remember to form the \\nrounded incisal/occlusal embrasures that con-\\ntour to form proximal contacts with the adja-\\ncent tooth, and then taper narrower toward the \\nconvex cervical line (which, in health, parallels \\nthe free gingival margin) (see Fig. C).\\nLearning Exercise, cont.

Some evidence indicates that people with severe \\noverjet exhibit more crackling or grating noise in \\ntheir joint (called crepitus or crepitation) because \\nof the frequent necessity to protrude the jaw con-\\nsiderably forward in order to properly enunciate \\nand to incise.\\nB. People with a class II, division 1 malocclusion \\noften have a long face, a narrow maxillary arch \\nwith high palate, diminished muscle tone in the \\nupper lip, and an overactive lower lip.\\n12\\nC. People with class II, division 2 malocclusion often \\nexhibit unique oral traits including a short, wide \\nface, square arch, severe anteroposterior curve \\n(of Spee), anterior crowding, and well-developed \\nchin musculature.\\n12\\nD. In addition to a massive mandible, people with \\nclass III occlusion have a long narrow face, a \\ntapered upper arch with a high vaulted palate, \\nincreased activity of their upper lip, and decreased \\nactivity of their lower lip. Crepitus is not common \\nwith class III malocclusion since little, if any, \\nprotrusion is required to clearly enunciate or to \\nincise.\\nE. From eight unrelated surveys of the prevalence \\nof malocclusion treated by orthodontists on \\n21,328 children, ages 6 to 18, in the United States \\nbetween 1951 and 1971, Dr. Woelfel averaged the \\nresults and derived the following information:\\n71.7% had malocclusion (range: 31 to 95%)•\\n28.3% had acceptable occlusion•\\n72.3% of those with malocclusion had Angle’s •\\nclass I malocclusion (range: 62 to 88%)\\n22.0% of those with malocclusion had Angle’s •\\nclass II malocclusion (range: 8 to 32%)\\n5.7% of those with malocclusion had Angle’s •\\nclass III malocclusion (range: 2 to 12%)\\nF. Even in the highest order of apes (chimpanzee), \\nthe mandible can only drop open in a simple \\nhinge movement.\\nG. The maximum separation of the incisors for a \\npure hinge opening (maximum hinge opening in \\nFig. 9-20) averages only 22.4 mm or 44% of maxi-\\nmum opening on 352 subjects (Table 9-4).\\nH. The frequency of crepitation among 1099 den-\\ntal hygiene and dental students was presented \\nin Table 9-5 . Over one third of these students \\nhad some crepitus while opening widely; it was \\nslightly more prevalent on the right side than on \\nthe left side and was more common in women \\nthan in men.\\nI. An exhaustive study on the TMJ by Turell includes \\ncolor pictures of many human TMJs—some \\nhealthy, some with displaced discs, and others dis-\\neased with osteoarthritis.\\n11 This project involved \\ndissection and analysis of joints from 100 cadav-\\ners (dead for <12 hours). Joint conditions were \\nfound to be directly related to existing occlusal \\nrelationships. Older people with their teeth and \\nnatural occlusion had normal joints. Internal joint \\nchanges were determined to be more common in \\nthe elderly only because of occlusal interferences, \\nloss of teeth, heavy attrition, and uncorrected \\nmalposition of teeth. It was concluded that many \\nof the alterations seen in osteoarthritic TMJs had \\nbeen caused by abnormal, heavy forces within the'),\n",

It is a fascinat-\\ning treatise.\\nJ. Posselt found the distance between centric rela-\\ntion and MIP to average 1.25 ±1 mm with a range \\nof 0.25 to 2.55 mm.\\n21\\nK. The average incisal guidance angle for 1114 den-\\ntal hygiene and dental students is 50° as shown in \\nTable 9-6. Many of these people did not have ideal \\nclass I occlusion.\\nL. The average maximum forward protrusion for \\n1114 young men and women was 8.3 mm with \\na range from 2.5 to 16.0 mm (Table 9-3). These \\nextremes included a very tight TMJ compartment \\nthat exhibited the smallest protrusion, and a very \\nlarge jaw with loose ligament attachments that \\nexhibited 16 mm protrusion.\\nM. The maximum average movement to either the \\nright or left side was about 8.1 mm. Therefore, \\nthe entire lateral movement from right to left \\naveraged 16.2 mm compared to an average for-\\nward protrusion of only 8.3 mm (Table 9-3).\\nN. The nonworking side mandibular condyle moves \\nmedially, downward, and forward perhaps 5 \\nto 12 mm. As seen in Table 9-7, of 342 dental \\nhygiene students examined, 26.8% had nonwork-\\ning side interferences in at least one side.\\nO. Group function  is much different from disoc-\\nclusion because multiple posterior teeth contact \\nalong with the canines on the working side.\\n1,8 As \\nseen in Table 9-6, the average canine guidance \\nangle was a little steeper (at 56 and 57°) than \\nthe anterior guidance (at 50°). To have a canine-\\nprotected articulation where the overlap of the \\ncanine teeth disengages the posterior teeth dur-\\ning excursive movements of the mandible, it is \\nusually necessary to have a canine angle of over \\n60°. Dr. Woelfel found canine-protected articu-\\nlation with posterior disocclusion in 60.2% of \\nthe natural dentitions of dental hygiene students \\n(Table 9-7).\\nP. Complete Denture occlusion: The desirable type \\nof relationship in a patient who has no teeth and \\nmust wear a set of complete dentures is bilateral \\nbalanced occlusion. This occurs when all of the \\nposterior teeth contact on the working side and \\none or more teeth on the balancing side contact \\nsimultaneously. With complete dentures, the \\nbilateral balancing contacts help to prevent the \\ndentures from tipping and coming loose. It is \\nconsidered undesirable for a patient with natural \\nteeth, however, to have any tooth contact on the \\nnonworking side.\\nQ. There is a pause of about 0.16 second ( silent\\nperiod) between chewing into MIP and commenc-\\ning the net chewing stroke. The duration of each \\nchewing cycle varies from 0.7 to 1.2 seconds in \\nmost people.\\n32'),\n",

The tug-\\nof-war between demineralization and remineralization \\nis constant and is the basis for prevention methods that \\nare applied and taught by dental professionals.\\nPatient education and preventive treatment are \\nimportant aspects of dental patient care. Prevention \\nand treatment should be based on personalized risk-\\nbased assessment of each patient’s caries history, which \\nincludes their history of fluoride use, their salivary \\nflow rate, and the frequency of sugar uptake (espe-\\ncially snacks).\\n2,3 Fluoride [FLOOR ide] applied to \\nteeth in appropriate concentrations has been shown \\nto reduce dental caries incidence because it increases \\nthe tooth’s resistance to breakdown by caries-forming \\nacids. Therefore, caries prevention includes daily use \\nof f luoride-containing paste and fluoride-containing \\nmouthwashes (either prescription or over the coun-\\nter), as well as office-applied fluorides. Further, since \\nsaliva is normally rich in minerals like calcium, healthy \\nsaliva flow  improves remineralization. When saliva \\nflow is reduced (from damage to the salivary glands \\ndue to radiation therapy, or as a side effect of certain \\nmedications), teeth are more susceptible to tooth decay. \\nArtificial saliva or sugarless chewing gum (which stimu-\\nlates saliva flow) can be used to alleviate this problem.\\nFinally, patients must be educated to reduce the \\namount and frequency of carbohydrates in the diet and \\nto remove harmful bacteria off of the teeth. Since more \\nacids form when teeth are exposed frequently to snacks, \\nfrequent snacking must be curtailed . Frequent intake of \\ncarbonated, nondiet soft drinks can be especially dam-\\naging since these drinks not only contain sugar but are \\nalso mildly acidic due to the carbonation. Since bacteria \\nin plaque can, over time, begin to form enough acid \\nto begin destroying teeth, it is important to remove all \\nplaque frequently and thoroughly.\\nIn a 1979 to 1980 survey representing 45.3 million \\nU.S. school children between the ages of 5 and 17 years, \\nthe estimated prevalence of breakdown in permanent \\ndentition was 4.77 decayed, missing, or filled surfaces \\nper child.\\n4 Comparing data from two studies conducted \\nfor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \\nnumber of carious permanent teeth (both treated and \\nuntreated) in children from 6 to 18 years old decreased \\nby 57% from 1971–1974 through 1988–1994 (decreas-\\ning from 4.44 to 1.9 carious teeth).\\n5 These studies \\nalso showed a 40% decline in the number of primary \\nteeth with caries in two to ten year olds (from 2.29 to \\n1.38). These and other reports have shown a world-\\nwide decrease in the incidence of coronal caries, espe-\\ncially in children and adolescents, ranging from 10 to \\n60% depending on the article cited. However, the \\nnumber of adults older than 65 is expected to double \\nby 2025, and people are keeping their teeth longer \\n(53% of persons older than 65 still have at least 20 \\nnatural teeth).\\n6 Further, the prevalence of root caries \\nA\\n B\\nFIGURE 10-1.

Additionally , with improvements in the proper-\\nties of contemporary esthetic restorative materials, the \\ndecline in caries rate is being offset by the increased \\nnumber of patients who ask for dental procedures that \\nimprove esthetics.\\nThere are two broad classifications of tooth decay \\nbased on the anatomy of the tooth surface involved: \\npit and fissure, and smooth surface. Caries prone pit \\nand fissures  form when enamel lobes fuse incom-\\npletely during tooth development. These pits and fis-\\nsures are often nearly impossible to keep clean. Note \\nthe deep occlusal fissures on the occlusal surfaces of \\na molar in Fig. 10-1 . Remember that pits and fissures \\nare located most often on the occlusal surfaces of \\nposterior teeth (molars and premolars), as well as on \\nthe lingual surface of maxillary molars, on the buccal \\nsurface of mandibular molars, and in the lingual fos-\\nsae of maxillary incisors, especially lateral incisors. \\nA small pit and fissure lesion may be almost undetect-\\nable externally ( Fig. 10-2), but as it progresses deeper, \\nthe decay widens within the fissure as it approaches \\nthe dentinoenamel junction (DEJ). Then, when it \\nreaches the DEJ, it spreads faster because dentin is \\nless mineralized than enamel, especially near the DEJ \\n(seen on the occlusal surfaces of molars in Fig. 10-1A \\nand B).\\nIn contrast to pit and fissure caries, smooth sur-\\nface carious lesions  occur on the smooth surfaces of \\nthe anatomic crown of a tooth in locations that are not \\nreadily accessible to the natural cleansing action of \\nthe lips, cheeks, and tongue.

These \\nterms can be used to define courses within a dental \\ncurriculum and are used in the literature to categorize \\ntypes of dental treatments. The first term, operative\\ndentistry, includes the art and science of the diagno-\\nsis, treatment, and prognosis of defects in teeth that \\nrequire restorations that do not cover  the entire tooth \\ncrown. Most of this chapter is devoted to the concepts \\nand cavity preparation terminology applied to conser-\\nvative restorations placed when treating small carious \\nlesions that are confined to enamel or have progressed \\nonly slightly deeper than the DEJ.\\nWhen tooth destruction increases in size, larger res-\\ntorations that cover (and protect) all or most of the \\nocclusal surface may be a more appropriate restoration \\nof choice. These larger restorations often surround and \\ncover all or part of the exposed tooth and include crowns \\n(also known by many as “caps”) or onlays. The goal of \\nthe dentist when placing both large and small tooth res-\\ntorations is to reproduce proper tooth form, function, \\nand esthetics while maintaining a harmonious relation-\\nship with the adjacent hard and soft tissues, all of which \\nenhances the general health and welfare of the patient.\\n10\\nRestorative dentistry  is a term used to describe \\nthe phase of clinical dentistry that involves the resto-\\nration of lost tooth structure of individual teeth and/\\nor replacement of lost or missing teeth with the ulti-\\nmate goal of reestablishing a healthy ,  functioning,\\nand comfortable dentition.

(A prosthesis [pros THEE \\nsis] is defined as an artificial replacement of a missing \\npart of the human body .) Fixed prosthodontics is the \\nbranch of prosthodontics concerned with the replace-\\nment and/or restoration of teeth with parts that cannot\\nbe readily removed from the mouth. An example is a \\ndental bridge (more appropriately called a fixed den-\\ntal prosthesis) where artificial teeth are cemented onto \\nadjacent teeth in the mouth. Removable prosthodon-\\ntics involves the replacement of teeth with devices that \\ncan be readily removed. Examples include a complete \\ndenture (also called a complete removable dental pros-\\nthesis but known to the public as false teeth or a den-\\nture) or a removable partial denture prosthesis (called \\na partial denture), both of which can and should be \\nremoved often for easy cleaning and to maintain tissue \\nhealth. These prostheses will be described in the last \\nsection of this chapter.\\nDENTAL MATERIALS USED TO RESTORE TEETHSECTION III\\nThe success of decay prevention techniques taught in \\ndental offices and presented in the media is an impor-\\ntant factor for reducing the number and size of restora-\\ntions being placed in the adult population. Susceptible \\nsmooth surfaces can be protected by the application of \\nfluoride and fluoride varnish, which strengthens the \\nenamel and can even reverse early bacterial damage in \\nlesions on smooth surfaces. Also, susceptible pits and \\nfissures can be treated with sealants before the caries \\nprocess has begun. These efforts reduce the number of \\ninvasive (surgical or cutting) procedures.\\nWhen it is deemed necessary to use surgical tech-\\nniques to restore small carious defects, conservative \\ntooth preparations are most often filled with dental \\namalgam, composite resin, and glass ionomer or resin \\nionomer. The materials of choice for restoring larger \\ndefects that require protection of thin remaining tooth \\nstructure include cast gold or semiprecious or nonpre-\\ncious metals, and porcelain.\\nA. AMALGAM\\nDental amalgam  has been a widely used restorative \\nmaterial owing to its ease of placement and rela-\\ntively low cost. It is silver in color and is condensed \\n(packed) into a preparation in successive small incre-\\nments that, within several hours, becomes a hard \\nmass that can withstand chewing forces. Therefore, \\namalgam is often used for restorations on the chewing \\n(or occlusal) surfaces of posterior teeth and to restore \\nposterior proximal contacts, but when esthetics is not \\na factor (Fig. 10-5).\\nB. ESTHETIC RESTORATIVE \\nMATERIALS\\nEsthetic restorative materials such as composite resin, \\nglass ionomer, and resin ionomer are being increasingly \\nused due to patients’ demands for esthetic restorations. \\nComposite resin is a tooth-colored restorative material \\nthat is applied into a preparation in a dough-like consis-\\ntency . It hardens quickly when exposed to a light source. \\nDue to initial concerns about the strength and abrasion \\nresistance of composite resins,\\n11,12 it was historically \\nused primarily for restoring the proximal surfaces of \\nanterior teeth and the facial surfaces of teeth on which \\nesthetics was a chief concern ( Fig. 10-6A). Newer gen-\\nerations of esthetic restorative materials perform better \\nin posterior areas, so composite is replacing amalgam as \\nthe restoration of choice for small class I and II lesions \\n(Fig. 10-6B ). One longitudinal study rated composite \\nrestorations after 10 years (using a U.S. Public Health \\nsystem of evaluation) to be over 90% satisfactory for \\ncolor stability , surface smoothness, anatomic form, \\nlack of recurrent caries, and pulp response.\\n13 Only mar-\\nginal adaptation was scored below 90%, with a score of \\n81%.

Also, when there \\nare large cavities, an adhesive (bonded) indirect com-\\nposite restoration that has adequate wear resistance can \\nbe used to strengthen the remaining tooth.\\n10\\nGlass ionomer  and related materials such as \\nresin-modified glass ionomer are recommended for the \\ntreatment of caries on the root surface or over erosion \\nlesions.\\n16 These materials bond chemically to dentin, \\nare reasonably esthetic, and contain fluoride, which \\nprotects the tooth against future caries. \\nC. CAST METAL RESTORATIONS\\nWhen the tooth structure is weak and needs to be pro-\\ntected from occlusal forces, a cast restoration is often the \\ntreatment of choice. Cast gold or semiprecious metals \\ncan be used for constructing onlays (restorations, which \\ncover cusp tips) or complete cast crowns (which cover \\nthe entire tooth crown). A gold onlay is seen on tooth \\nNo. 3 in Figure 10-7A, and a complete cast metal crown is \\nseen on tooth No. 31 in Figure 10-7B. These cast restora-\\ntions are constructed on a precise dental stone reproduc-\\ntion of the individual prepared tooth called a die (seen \\nlater in Fig. 10-21). Since they are constructed outside \\nof the mouth, cast metal restorations can be contoured \\nmore perfectly than an  amalgam restoration that must \\nbe contoured in the mouth.

Finally , cast metal restorations have better marginal \\nstability over time. However, since considerably more \\ntime is required to restore a tooth with a cast restora-\\ntion (including the laboratory procedures outside of the \\nmouth) than for composite resin or amalgam restora-\\ntions that are placed the same day the tooth is prepared, \\ncast restorations are more expensive for the patient.\\nD.

Porcelain can also be used to \\nconstruct all ceramic restorations (crowns) (seen later \\nin Fig. 10-45) or metal ceramic restorations or crowns \\nwhere porcelain is fused to underlying metal in order to \\nprovide an esthetic result (teeth numbers 28, 29, and \\n30 in Fig. 10-7B).\\nPRINCIPLES OF CAVITY PREPARATIONSECTION IV\\nBasic principles of cavity preparation  were developed \\nby Dr. G.V . Black in the early 1900s and are uniquely \\napplied to each class of caries and type of restorative \\nmaterial. Today , the application of his principles has \\nbeen modified due to the introduction of new den-\\ntal restorative materials that were not available in his \\nday . A dentist still needs to consider each principle \\nwhen preparing a tooth for a conservative operative \\nrestoration.\\nA. ESTABLISH AN OUTLINE FORM\\nThe outline form of a preparation is the external shape \\nof the preparation where prepared tooth meets unpre-\\npared tooth. It is developed by removing the least \\namount of tooth structure possible, yet adhering to the \\nfollowing principles:\\n1. EXTEND THE PREPARATION \\nTO SOUND ENAMEL\\nThe dentist enlarges the preparation outline so that it \\nextends to enamel that has no signs of active decay . \\nAlso, when the dentist ends the preparation on enamel \\nmargins, the enamel must be able to withstand the \\nforces required when placing the restoration, and the \\nforces applied during tooth function. In many cases, \\nthis involves extending the preparation to enamel that \\nis supported by , or resting on, sound dentin that is not \\nundermined by the spread of caries within the den-\\ntin. Since enamel is brittle, if it is not sufficiently sup-\\nported by sound dentin and/or bonding techniques, \\nthe unsupported, brittle enamel rods may fracture, \\nleaving a gap between the tooth and the restorative \\nmaterial.\\n2. EXTEND THE PREPARATION \\nFOR PREVENTION\\nThe dentist evaluates the need to enlarge the prepara-\\ntion within enamel beyond the specific area of decay \\nin order to include adjacent tooth structure felt to be \\nprone to the development of future decay . For example, \\nwhen treating a carious pit and fissure lesion, it may \\nbe advisable to include adjacent deep pits and fissures \\nthought to be caries prone, even though they have not \\nyet become carious. Similarly , when developing the \\ncavity preparation for smooth surface carious lesions, \\nthe outline of the preparation may be extended to \\ninclude adjacent smooth surface areas likely to become \\ncarious.\\nThe dentist must determine whether or not to extend \\nthe outline based on a risk assessment of that patient. \\nOver the past 35 years, there has been a tremendous \\nincrease in the use of fluoride (in community water, \\ntoothpaste, rinses, and topical applications applied \\nperiodically in the dental office), as well as improved \\nefforts by dental professionals to educate the popula-\\ntion in prevention techniques. Therefore, the need for \\npreventive extension on smooth surface lesions must be \\nweighed against the possibility that excellent hygiene \\nand fluoride could stop or even reverse the decay pro-\\ncess, especially if the decay has not progressed too far.'),\n",

For example, extension for prevention for a \\ntooth preparation on a younger patient with multiple \\nareas of active decay, poor oral hygiene, and frequent \\nintake of high-sugar snacks and sugar-containing car-\\nbonated beverages who is unwilling or unable to change\\nis more appropriate than it would be in an older patient \\nwith a lower caries rate, better eating habits, and good \\nor improving oral hygiene.\\n3. PROVIDE ADEQUATE ACCESS\\nA restoration outline must be large enough for the den-\\ntist to ensure that all carious tooth structure has been \\nremoved and that instruments required to insert the fill-\\ning material will fit. A small, narrow initial cut through \\nthe enamel might not permit the dentist to confirm the \\nremoval of all caries that may have spread laterally at \\nthe DEJ. Further, even when the removal of all caries \\ncan be verified visually or by probing, the initial prepa-\\nration might be too small to place the restoration with-\\nout voids.\\n4. PROVIDE RESISTANCE FORM\\nThe dentist must design a preparation to ensure room \\nfor an adequate thickness of restorative material  for \\nstrength, and sufficient remaining solid tooth structure\\nto withstand or resist occlusal forces. This is known as \\nresistance form. If the preparation depth is inadequate \\nfor the material of choice to withstand occlusal forces, \\nthe restoration could break. If the remaining tooth \\nstructure is too thin or undermined, it could fracture.\\nB. PROVIDE RETENTION FORM\\nRetention form is the design of a preparation that pre-\\nvents the restoration from falling out. The methods \\nfor providing retention differ depending on the restor-\\native material and on the location of the carious lesion. \\nRetention for amalgam restorations is provided by inter-\\nnal retentive features, such as retentive grooves, and by \\nthe convergence of some preparation walls. Retention\\nfor composite resin restorations is provided by acid etch-\\ning the enamel to produce microscopic irregularities \\n(minute undercuts) on the surface. Then, a first layer \\nof flowable resin  (bonding agent) can flow into the \\nirregularities forming retentive resin tags  that, when \\nhardened, mechanically lock into the microscopic reten-\\ntive features of the etched enamel ( Fig. 10-8 ). Layers \\nof the stronger composite resin can subsequently be \\nchemically bonded to the initial flowable resin layer \\nto complete the restoration. When using newer adhe-\\nsive agents, additional retention is gained by chemical \\nbonds formed between tooth and resin.\\nC. REMOVE CARIES AND TREAT \\nTHE PULP\\nAll principles of the cavity preparation described up \\nto this point assume that caries has spread just beyond \\nthe DEJ into dentin. The dentist usually prepares the \\noutline form and retention for a cavity preparation to \\na depth just beyond the DEJ with a high-speed den-\\ntal handpiece using carbide or diamond burs that cut \\nquickly, minimizing the potentially damaging heat by \\nFIGURE 10-8. The effect of etching enamel. A. Magnified \\nview of a nonetched enamel surface (3260 times bigger). \\nB. Magnified view of an etched enamel surface (3600 times \\nbigger) after application of 50% phosphoric acid.

When removing \\ncarious lesions that have progressed deeper into dentin,\\nthe dentist uses slowly rotating round burs in slow-\\nspeed handpieces, or hand instruments. The slow-speed \\nhandpiece, or hand instruments, permit the dentist to \\ndifferentiate between the softer carious dentin and the \\nharder healthy or noncarious dentin.\\nWhen caries extends close to the pulp, it may be \\nadvisable to protect the vital tissues of the tooth (odon-\\ntoblasts, blood vessels, and nerves within the pulp) \\nwith dental liners and cement bases prior to placing \\nthe final restoration (Fig. 10-9).

Model of an amalgam preparation illustrating \\nthree areas of the axial and pulpal walls that had caries deeper \\nthan ideal that were filled with a cement base (shown in green) \\nbefore the amalgam would be placed.\\nRESTORING EACH CLASS OF CARIESSECTION V\\nIn 1908, Dr. G.V. Black developed a comprehensive \\nmethod for classifying carious lesions that has been \\nuseful when describing specific principles of cavity \\npreparation.\\n20 The original classifications were G.V. \\nBlack classes I, II, III, IV, and V. All pit and fissure type \\nlesions are class I, whereas class II, III, IV, and V car-\\nies are all smooth surface–type lesions. The five clas-\\nsifications of decay devised and published by Dr. G.V. \\nBlack in 1908 are still appropriate to consider, although \\nthe principles of cavity preparation are now applied \\nuniquely for each class of decay, and for each new \\nrestorative material. Successful cavity preparations for \\nrestorative materials such as dental amalgam, compos-\\nite, resin, or cast metal are designed to allow placement \\nand maintenance of each restorative material and, at \\nthe same time, to ensure the preservation of remaining \\ntooth structure.\\nThe discussion of tooth restoration in this section \\nassumes that the tooth to be prepared for a restoration \\nis periodontally sound (i.e., has healthy periodontium \\nwith adequate bony support) and that the maintenance \\nof the tooth is an integral part of the overall treatment \\nfor that patient.\\nA. CLASS I CARIES\\n1. CLASS I CARIES: DEFINED\\nClass I lesions  form in enamel pits and fissures and \\nmay form wherever deep inaccessible pits and fissures \\noccur ( Fig. 10-10 ). In a 1979 to 1980 survey of U.S. \\nschoolchildren aged 5 to 17 years, 54% of all carious \\nlesions were found on the occlusal surfaces.\\n4 In 2000, \\nstudies of teeth at risk showed that the occlusal surfaces\\nof the first molars are at greatest risk for initial caries,'),\n",

Careful visual analysis \\nof a clean, dry, well-lighted occlusal surface will reveal \\nthis type of caries as a fissure or pit surrounded by \\nenamel that is chalky or more opaque (less translucent) \\nthan the adjacent enamel (Fig. 10-10A). Some dentists \\nprefer to confirm caries within these suspicious defects \\nby probing with a very sharp explorer. When the den-\\ntist presses the explorer into the defect with moderate \\nto firm pressure, and, upon removal, senses a resistance \\n(known as tug-back), this helps to confirm the presence \\nof softness and therefore caries within the defect or fis-\\nsure wall. However, the firm use of the explorer for the \\ndetection of occlusal caries should be used with cau-\\ntion. One study suggests that the confirmation of decay \\nbased on tug-back may not always be accurate (there \\nmight not be decay, just a deep groove), and excessive\\nforce could actually damage fragile enamel rods on \\nthe tooth.\\n22 Even in the absence of obvious tug-back, \\nloss of translucency of enamel around a pit or fissure \\nmay be considered to be reliable evidence of attack. It \\nis especially important to avoid undue pressure with \\nthe explorer point in larger, frank lesions (as seen in \\nFig. 10-10B and E) because probing in these areas may \\ncause pain or additional enamel rod destruction.\\nA class I lesion is usually not detectable on a radio-\\ngraph until it has spread considerably into dentin \\nbecause the lesion is superimposed between the thick \\nbuccal and lingual surfaces of enamel, which show up \\nwhiter (radiopaque), thereby masking the darker color \\nof caries. By the time the cavity is visible on the radio-\\ngraph (Fig. 10-11), the size of the preparation required \\nto remove all of the decay would be considerably deeper \\n(toward the pulp) than if the decay had been detected \\nduring a good clinical examination when the lesion was \\nsmaller. Thus, early class I decay can be best diagnosed \\nABC\\nDE\\nFIGURE 10-10. Class I caries. A.

CLASS I CARIES: WHEN TO RESTORE\\nSome class I lesions are difficult to differentiate from \\nnoncarious, deep enamel defects. If tug-back occurs \\nwith a sharp explorer in a deep pit or fissure and the \\nsurrounding enamel is chalky or less translucent, a res-\\ntoration is indicated. However, if tug-back is slight but \\nthere is no accompanying evidence, the dentist might \\nconsider periodically reevaluating the area during \\nrecall appointments, especially if the patient is older \\nand has a low caries rate, since tug-back can occur \\nwhen probing in deep fissures even when caries is not \\npresent. Generally , multiple signs should be present to \\nmake a clinical diagnosis of caries and then consider \\nthe need for a restoration. Finally , it is important to \\nknow that if dental sealants  are applied shortly after \\ntooth eruption, pit and fissure decay on adult teeth can \\nbe prevented. For permanent first molars, this would \\nbe age 6, and for second molars, age 12. Certainly , by \\nthe time class I caries is obvious on the radiograph, it \\nwould be quite large, evident clinically , and should be \\nrestored.\\n3. CLASS I: CAVITY WALL TERMINOLOGY\\nThe traditional occlusal preparation for amalgam can \\nbe compared to a room (with no ceiling) that has four \\nvertical walls and a horizontal floor (sometimes called \\na fifth wall). The four vertical walls are named after the \\nclosest tooth surfaces, namely , buccal, mesial, lingual,\\nand distal; the horizontal floor is called the pulpal\\nfloor (or wall) because it is over the pulp (abbreviated \\nas B, M, L, D, and P in Fig. 10-12A). A line angle in \\nthe preparation is the line formed when two walls join. \\nThere are eight internal line angles in a conservative \\nclass I preparation (if the preparation is confined to \\nthe occlusal surface and is not extended into a buccal \\nor lingual groove). These are named by combining the \\nterms for the two walls that join to make up each line \\nangle, changing the suffix of the first word from “al” \\nto “o.” The junction of the pulpal floor and distal wall \\nis the distopulpal line angle. All possible line angles in \\na class I occlusal preparation include four horizontal \\nones (distopulpal, mesiopulpal, buccopulpal, and lin-\\nguopulpal), and four vertical ones (mesiobuccal, disto-\\nbuccal, mesiolingual, and distolingual).\\nFIGURE 10-11. A. Radiograph of a class I lesion (arrow) on tooth No. 31. By the time the lesion appeared this deep on the radio-\\ngraph, the caries had destroyed dentin to such a depth that a thermal-insulating base of some type of dental cement will possibly be \\nneeded to protect the pulp from thermal conductivity through the metal filling. This pit and fissure caries should have been detected\\nearlier with a good clinical examination. (There is also a large distal class II lesion on tooth No. 4, which appears to be rotated [top \\nright]). B. Spread pattern of class I decay: The occlusal lesion at the arrow (class I, pit and fissure) is small externally, widening \\ntoward the depth of the fissure as it approaches the DEJ.

These sealants have \\nbeen shown to be an effective means of preventing car-\\nies in pits and fissures.\\n23–25 An initial sealant applica-\\ntion for all permanent molars and premolars requires \\nonly 15 to 20 minutes per child.\\n26 If there is a slight \\nbit of decay in a groove, the dentist may make a very \\nsmall preparation, possibly confined to enamel. This \\nvery small preparation can be restored with a small \\namount of composite resin followed by a sealant to \\nprotect other deep grooves. This restoration is called a \\nconservative resin restoration (previously called a pre-\\nventive resin restoration  or PRR). A sealant and con-\\nservative resin preparation are shown in Figure 10-14.\\nConservative preparations can also be formed using an \\nair-abrasion system where abrasive particles are blown \\nforcefully toward the tooth to actually remove tooth \\nstructure. This technique  permits removal of only a \\nminimum amount of tooth structure, but the principles \\nof cavity preparation for this new technology (such as \\nproviding retention, obtaining access to the decay , and \\nextending to sound enamel, etc.) must still be consid-\\nered.

Extension for Prevention (Class I)\\nExtension for prevention, to include those pits and \\nfissures adjoining the defects with active decay, should \\nbe considered when the patient is young, has a high \\ncaries rate, and/or exhibits poor oral hygiene, but seal-\\nants may also be used to protect adjacent pits and fis-\\nsures. Examples of several amalgam preparations that \\ninclude all major grooves can be seen in Figure 10-15.\\nb. Resistance Form (Class I)\\nWhen amalgam is used on a stress-bearing surface, \\na minimum depth (of 1.5 to 2 mm) is recommended \\ndue to the brittleness of amalgam in thinner layers. \\nHowever, if cast metal is used, less reduction (of only \\n1 mm) will provide room for a sufficient bulk of gold \\nto withstand occlusal forces and preserve more tooth \\nstructure. Ideally , amalgam meets the unprepared tooth \\nsurface at right angles to provide resistance to marginal \\nbreakage, whereas the preparation margins for small \\ncast restorations end with a bevel at the cavosurface \\n(Fig. 10-16 ). Bevels are angular enamel reductions \\nplaced at the cavosurface of cast metal preparations in \\norder for the margins (or outer edges) of the casting to \\nbe thin enough so that the dentist can perfect the adap-\\ntation and minimize the cavosurface gap between tooth \\nand metal. The goal is to minimize the gap between the \\ncasting and tooth since this gap is filled with a dental \\ncement, which is neither as strong nor as durable as \\nthe metal.\\nc. Retention (Class I)\\nFor amalgam, retention is provided in an occlusal \\npreparation by a slight convergence of the buccal and \\nlingual preparation walls toward the occlusal surface. \\nThe buccal and lingual cavity walls each form almost \\na right angle with the uncut tooth at the cavosurface \\nthat permits a good bulk of amalgam to abut against a \\nstrong enamel surface (Fig. 10-12C).\\nFor composite preparations, retention is also pro-\\nvided by acid etching  the enamel to produce micro-\\nscopic irregularities on the surface that can be filled \\nwith a first layer of flowable bonding agent.\\nFor inlays or onlays (cast gold or porcelain), reten-\\ntion is provided by preparing the opposing internal \\nwalls of the preparation with a slight (5 to 7°) diver-\\ngence toward the occlusal surface (as seen within the \\nclass II gold inlay preparation in Fig. 10-16), thus \\nallowing the solid casting to be seated snugly within \\nthe tooth, somewhat like a glass stopper fitting into the \\nopening of a decanter. The dental cement (or sealant \\nfor porcelain) placed between the inlay and the tooth \\nprovides retention by sealing the margins and by set-\\nting to hardness at the interface between the slight \\nirregularities of the enamel walls of the preparation and \\nthose of the inlay/onlay. Some types of dental cement \\nchemically bond to the calcium of the tooth and can \\nbe mechanically attached to the etched surface of metal \\ncastings.\\nB. CLASS II CARIES\\n1.

CLASS II CARIES: WHEN TO RESTORE\\nClass II lesions that are clinically obvious, when \\ncavitated (with a break or hole in the surface), should \\nbe restored (Fig. 10-17D). The radiographic indication \\nfor restoring a small lesion is when the lesion has pen-\\netrated to the DEJ and begins to spread out into dentin \\n(teeth numbers 12 and 19 in Fig. 10-19B). If the lesion \\nis small enough to be confined to enamel on the radio-\\ngraph, the dentist must consider the patient’s previ-\\nous history of carious activity, oral hygiene, and age in \\norder to decide whether to restore now or to reevaluate \\nat subsequent recall intervals. The use of fluoride and \\nfluoride varnishes has improved the potential to arrest \\nearly lesions. However, a young patient with a small car-\\nious lesion only two thirds of the way through enamel, \\nbut with many deeper lesions and poor oral hygiene \\nthat is not improving, should probably have the tooth \\nrestored, especially since a lesion extends deeper in the \\nactual tooth than it appears on the radiograph.\\n9\\n3. CLASS II: CAVITY WALL TERMINOLOGY\\nTo reach and remove class II lesions (which form just \\ncervical to the proximal contact), the dentist most often \\nneeds to prepare a proximal box  that extends cervi-\\ncally through the marginal ridge. The proximal box is \\nextended to a level that is more gingival than the pulpal \\nfloor of a class I preparation and has vertical buccal, \\nlingual, and axial walls (the axial wall is along the long \\naxis of the tooth) and a horizontal gingival wall  (or \\nfloor) (all labeled with abbreviations in Fig. 10-20).\\nFurther, class II lesions can involve just one or both \\nproximal surfaces of a posterior tooth (i.e., have one or \\ntwo proximal boxes). Since obtaining access into the \\nproximal lesion normally requires breaking through \\nthe occlusal marginal ridge, these restorations involve a \\nminimum of two (occlusal and mesial, or occlusal and \\ndistal) or three (mesial, occlusal, and distal) surfaces.\\nThe line angles that are present in a mesial or distal \\nproximal box are axiopulpal, axiogingival, buccogin-\\ngival, linguogingival, axiobuccal, and axiolingual. In a \\nmesio-occlusodistal preparation, you can differentiate \\neach line angle in a proximal box by stating whether \\nit is located in the mesial or distal box. For example, \\nthere are two axiopulpal line angles in the mesio-\\nocclusodistal amalgam preparation: One is the axiop-\\nulpal line angle of the mesial box and the other is the \\naxiopulpal line angle of the distal box. The point angles \\nin each box include axiolinguogingival (A-L-G in Fig. \\n10-20B), axiobuccogingival, axiobuccopulpal, and \\naxiolinguopulpal.\\nClass II preparations for amalgam involving only two \\nsurfaces, such as mesio-occlusal or disto-occlusal, are \\ntraditionally abbreviated as MO-A or DO-A (not OM-A \\nor OD-A). A mesio-occlusodistal amalgam prepara-\\ntion is abbreviated as MOD-A (not DOM-A). A class II \\nFIGURE 10-19. Radiographs of class II lesions. A.

CLASS II CARIES: APPLIED PRINCIPLES \\nOF CAVITY PREPARATION\\nThe preparation for a class II carious lesion can be \\nrestored with amalgam, direct composite, inlays, or \\nonlays (cast metal or tooth colored). Improvements in \\ncomposite restorative materials and techniques have \\nresulted in the increased use of this tooth-colored mate-\\nrial for class II restorations, especially when esthetics \\nis an important factor. The larger the preparation (and \\ntherefore the thinner the remaining tooth structure), \\nthe more appropriate the onlay restoration might be to \\ncover the cusp tips, protect the remaining thin tooth, \\nand provide adequate resistance form (seen in gold on \\ntooth No. 31 in Fig. 10-21).\\na. Extension for Prevention (Class II)\\nThe class II preparation often extends over some of the \\nocclusal surface to include adjacent defective or cari-\\nous occlusal pits and fissures as in a class I preparation. \\nThe proximal box might be compared to a stair step \\ndescending farther gingivally than the occlusal portion \\n(Fig. 10-22A and B). When proximal decay is present \\nbut there are no carious fissures on the occlusal surface, \\nthe dentist may prepare a slot preparation. This conser-\\nvative preparation is just the proximal box of the tradi-\\ntional class II amalgam preparation with no extension \\nacross the occlusal surface into the occlusal grooves \\n(Fig. 10-22C). Notice that in Figure 10-22A, the maxil-\\nlary molar preparation does not extend over the oblique \\nridge since there is seldom a susceptible groove in this \\narea. Also, the DO-A preparation on the mandibu-\\nlar first premolar does not cross the transverse ridge \\n(which seldom has a deep groove), nor does it include \\nthe mesial pit if it is not deeply fissured or carious.\\nThe class I portion follows the principles for restoring \\na class I lesion already discussed, but the proximal exten-\\nsion (box) adds new features. For example, the buccal \\nand lingual walls of the proximal box of class II prepa-\\nrations are prepared beyond the proximal contact areas \\njust into the buccal and lingual embrasures (Fig. 10-23). \\nIn this way , the margins of the restoration can be better \\nevaluated by the dentist and kept clean by the patient.\\nb.

CLASS III CARIES\\n1. CLASS III CARIES: DEFINED\\nClass III lesions  are smooth surface lesions located \\non the proximal surfaces of anterior teeth, just cervical \\nto the proximal contact, but not involving the incisal \\nangle (or corner) of the tooth (Fig. 10-25).\\nAn incipient (small or beginning) class III lesion can \\noften be detected clinically by carefully examining the \\nenamel facially or lingually for changes in translucency \\njust cervical to the proximal contact ( Fig. 10-26). The \\nunderlying lesion causes overlying enamel to appear \\nslightly darker or more opaque than surrounding, sound \\nenamel. These changes are most evident when a source \\nof light (such as fiber optics) is placed lingually against \\nthe proximal enamel of the tooth, revealing the change \\nin translucency facially ( Fig. 10-27 ). This method of \\nclinical detection is called transillumination.\\nRadiographs of the anterior teeth can also be used to \\nconfirm a class III lesion (Fig. 10-28). The location, just \\ncervical to the proximal contact, and pattern of spread \\nare both typical of smooth surface lesions that were \\ndescribed for a class II lesion.\\n2. CLASS III CARIES: WHEN TO RESTORE\\nThe indications for restoring a class III lesion are the same \\nas for a class II lesion: That is, if the surface is cavitated or \\ndecay has reached the dentin as seen on the radiograph \\nor through transillumination, a restoration is indicated.\\n3. CLASS III: CAVITY WALL TERMINOLOGY\\nSince the class III resin restoration obtains retention in \\nmost cases from the bonding of resin to etched enamel \\nand to dentin, the final shape of a resin class III prepa-\\nration may be somewhat amorphous, removing only \\nFIGURE 10-24.

Sometimes, how-\\never, a more defined, traditional preparation may be \\ndesirable. The traditional preparation for the lingual\\napproach for a class III composite is represented in Figure\\n10-29A. This lingual approach preparation can be com-\\npared to the slot preparation of a class II preparation, \\nwhich is also cut through the marginal ridge. However, \\ndue to the more horizontal alignment of the box of a \\nclass III preparation, the names assigned to the walls \\ndiffer. Here, the four walls are called gingival, facial, \\nincisal, and axial (as abbreviated in Fig. 10-30A and B).\\nThere are only five internal line angles: gingivofacial, \\nincisofacial, gingivoaxial, facioaxial, and incisoaxial. \\nThere are only two internal point angles: gingivofacio-\\naxial and incisofacioaxial.\\nThe traditional preparation for a composite with a \\nfacial approach may be more triangular in shape (with \\nits base near the gingiva). It has three walls and a floor \\n(Fig. 10-29B). The three walls are the facial, lingual, \\nand gingival walls, and the fourth wall (or floor) is \\nthe axial. Subsequently, this preparation has six inter-\\nnal line angles: facioaxial, linguoaxial, gingivoaxial, \\nfaciolingual, linguogingival, and gingivofacial. There \\nare only three internal point angles: faciolinguoaxial \\n(abbreviated F-L-A in Fig. 10-30C), linguogingivoaxial, \\nand faciogingivoaxial.\\nClass III composite restorations may be abbreviated \\nby identifying the proximal surface, as well as the sur-\\nface through which access was gained and the mate-\\nrial used. For example, the class III composite on the \\nmesial surface of tooth No. 10 (in Fig. 10-29C) with \\naccess to the decay through the lingual enamel would \\nbe identified as M-C, No. 10, lingual approach, or more \\nprecisely , ML-C, No. 10.

The preparation \\nshape therefore can be more conservative, without the \\nneed for internal retentive grooves or pits.\\nD. CLASS IV CARIES\\n1. CLASS IV CARIES: DEFINED\\nA class IV lesion involves the proximal surface of an \\nanterior tooth (as does a class III lesion), but, in addi-\\ntion, it involves the incisal angle (or corner) of the tooth \\n(Fig. 10-31). The class IV lesion is frequently the result \\nof a class III lesion that became so large that the under-\\nmined tooth angle broke off. A similar-shaped defect \\noccurs when the tooth corner fractures off due to a blow \\nto the mouth. The loss of an incisal angle is plainly vis-\\nible upon clinical examination. Radiographs are not \\nneeded to detect the class IV lesion but may be useful to \\ndetermine the depth of the lesion relative to its proxim-\\nity to the pulp chamber (Fig. 10-32).\\n2. CLASS IV CARIES: WHEN TO RESTORE\\nThe class IV restoration is indicated when active  caries \\nis detected. Many class IV restorations are indicated, \\nhowever, not because of caries but because the incisal \\nangle of the tooth has fractured off in an accident. In \\nthese instances, the extent of the fracture, the proxim-\\nity of the exposed tooth structure to the pulp cham-\\nber, hypersensitivity to temperature changes, and the \\npatient’s concern for esthetics are important factors \\nwhen deciding whether or not to restore the tooth. \\nIf the fracture is not into the dentin and the patient \\nis not concerned about the appearance of the tooth, \\nsmoothing the rough edges of the tooth may suffice. \\nIf, however, dentin is involved or if there is evidence \\nof decay , a restoration is indicated to prevent discom-\\nfort from the exposed dentin and to stop the spread \\nof decay .\\n3. CLASS IV CARIES: CAVITY WALL \\nTERMINOLOGY\\nDepending on the degree of involvement, this prepara-\\ntion may have only one flat wall (as in a fracture; similar \\nto the shape seen in Fig. 10-33) or may be made up of \\ntwo main surfaces: a gingival surface and a more axial \\nsurface. These two portions may join at an angle called \\nthe axiogingival line angle. There are no point angles.\\nA composite restoration that restores one incisal \\nangle actually restores parts of four surfaces, so it \\nmay be abbreviated as either an MIFL-C or DIFL-C \\n(Fig. 10-34) to denote the involvement of all surfaces \\nof either the mesioincisal or the distoincisal angle of \\nthe tooth. If both proximal surfaces were involved, the \\nrestoration would be designated as MIDFL-C. As usual, \\nthe tooth number can be added before the abbreviation, \\nfor example, No. 9 MIDFL-C.\\nFIGURE 10-31. Class IV caries. A.

CLASS IV CARIES: APPLIED PRINCIPLES \\nOF CAVITY PREPARATION\\nIf a class IV preparation is conservative, a composite \\nresin, particularly one that utilizes an acid-etching \\ntechnique, is the restoration of choice. An alternative \\ntreatment is a veneer of porcelain bonded to the facial \\nsurface of the tooth, replacing the fractured incisal area \\n(seen previously in Fig. 10-7A). If the preparation is \\nextensive or if the whole incisal edge of the tooth and \\nboth proximal surfaces are involved, but there is suf-\\nficient remaining tooth structure, it may be better to \\nrestore the tooth with a full crown that has a tooth-\\ncolored facial surface, or an all ceramic restoration \\n(crown), for the best esthetics and longevity.\\nCaries removal and smoothing extremely rough or \\nunsupported enamel may be all that is needed to pre-\\npare the tooth for a class IV composite. The occlusion, \\nas always, must be analyzed to be sure that there is \\nroom for the restoration when the patient chews and \\nincises, especially in a protrusive direction. Retention is \\nmost commonly achieved by acid-etch techniques that \\npermit resin tags to bond the composite to the tooth. \\nA thin overlapping sleeve of excess composite mate-\\nrial can cover beveled enamel that has been acid etched \\nto maximize retention (Fig. 10-33B) and to improve \\nesthetics by blending the color differential between \\ncomposite and enamel.\\nE. CLASS V CARIES\\n1. CLASS V CARIES: DEFINED\\nThe class V lesion  is located in the cervical one third \\nof the facial or lingual surface of any anterior or pos-\\nterior tooth crown ( Fig. 10-35). It is a smooth surface \\nlesion that results from poor oral hygiene in the area \\nof the tooth just cervical to the buccal or lingual crest \\nof curvature, adjacent to the gingiva, where the natural \\ncleansing action of the lips, tongue, and cheeks is inef-\\nfective. This area of the tooth is susceptible to plaque \\naccumulation and resultant caries. Over the lifetime of \\na tooth, the gingiva and supporting bone may recede \\nFIGURE 10-32.

In these \\nbeginning (incipient) lesions, care should be taken with \\nthe explorer not to break through an area of beginning \\ndemineralization that has not yet cavitated since excel-\\nlent oral hygiene and fluoride have been shown to \\nreverse the caries process. These lesions may be hid-\\nden slightly apical to the level of inflamed gingiva so \\nthat the use of the tactile sense obtained through the \\nexplorer is critical for detection of cavitation\\n9 and for \\ndistinction between these lesions (which are cavitated) \\nand a calcified buildup of calculus (which is felt as a \\nbump attached to the surface of the tooth).\\nOther areas of cavitation (or depressions) located \\nin the cervical of the crown and the adjacent root sur-\\nface include defects formed from erosion by acids, or \\nfrom abrasion (most commonly caused by abrasive \\ntoothpastes and improper tooth brushing [as seen in \\nFig. 10-36]), and a process known as abfraction (the loss \\nof hard tooth structure, which appears similar to abra-\\nsion but is caused by flexure or bending of the tooth \\ncaused by heavy occlusal forces). Caries may develop \\nat the depth of these defects. Also, as the root becomes \\nexposed to the oral environment due to gingival reces-\\nsion, the cementum, which is much less mineralized \\nthan enamel, is more susceptible to caries compared \\nto enamel. The result is root caries, a condition that \\nis occurring more frequently in our aging population \\n(Fig. 10-37).\\nAs with a radiograph of a class I lesion, the class V \\nlesion is superimposed over buccal or lingual surfaces \\nof enamel that show up whiter (radiopaque), thereby \\nmasking the darker (radiolucent) caries ( Fig. 10-38 ).\\nBy the time a class V lesion is evident on radiographs, \\nit has progressed far beyond the incipient stage and \\nwill require a much larger restoration than would have \\nbeen required if it were clinically diagnosed at its earli-\\nest stages. Therefore, the examiner should not depend \\non radiographs for detection of these lesions. However, \\nwhen discovering a cervically located radiolucency \\non a radiograph, the dentist should carefully evaluate \\nthe tooth to clinically prove or disprove the presence \\nFIGURE 10-35.

Darker (radiolucent) areas of cervical \\nabrasion, as well as older types of radiolucent restor-\\native materials, can appear like class V or root surface \\ncaries on radiographs.\\n2. CLASS V CARIES: WHEN TO RESTORE\\nNot all areas at the cervical of the tooth that are white \\nor darkly stained require a class V restoration (as in \\nFig. 10-35C) since these areas of beginning ( incipient)\\ndecay could respond to fluoride and improved oral \\nhygiene and actually remineralize so that no restoration \\nis required. Also, these defects could be areas of arrested \\n(old, inactive) decay , or noncarious cavitated defects \\ndue to abrasion, erosion, or abfraction. Class V lesions \\nrequire restorations when tooth structure is soft or cavi-\\ntated (as seen in Fig. 10-35B). Restorations should also \\nbe considered to protect noncarious defects (like abra-\\nsion defects) that occur in this part of the tooth if the \\ntooth is sensitive and does not respond to desensitizing \\nagents, if the lesion is very deep and cannot be kept \\nclean, or if it appears that it will continue to advance \\ndue to poor oral hygiene or parafunctional habits.\\n3. CLASS V CARIES: CAVITY TERMINOLOGY\\nThe class V preparation is somewhat box shaped and \\nconsists of five walls: distal, occlusal, mesial, gingival, \\nand axial. These preparations have eight line angles: \\naxiomesial, axiogingival, axiodistal, axio-occlusal, \\nmesiogingival, distogingival, mesio-occlusal, and disto-\\nocclusal. The axio-occlusal and axiogingival line angles \\nare prepared with retentive grooves labeled as A-O and \\nA-G in Figure 10-39B. There are four point angles: axio-\\nocclusodistal (A-O-D in Fig. 10-39A), axio-occlusome-\\nsial, axiodistogingival, and axiomesiogingival.\\nThe restoration is identified by surface and material. \\nFor example, a buccal amalgam on tooth No. 19 is B-A, \\nNo. 19, a facial composite on tooth No. 7 is F-C, No. 7, \\nand a glass ionomer on the facial surface of tooth No. 11 \\nwould be F-GI, No. 11. Typically, the term facial (F) is \\napplied to anterior teeth, whereas buccal (B) is applied \\nto posterior teeth.\\n4. CLASS V CARIES: APPLIED PRINCIPLES \\nOF CAVITY PREPARATION\\nSince a class V lesion occurs in non–stress-bearing areas, \\nwhen esthetics is a factor, a composite may be used, \\neven though it may be less resistant to abrasion than \\namalgam (Fig. 10-40B). In gingival abrasion lesions and \\nareas of root caries, the dentist may restore the tooth \\nwith a glass ionomer or resin-modified glass ionomer \\nbecause they both bond to dentin and contain fluoride. \\nAmalgam may be used when the esthetics are not of \\nprime concern ( Fig. 10-40A ). In rare cases, primarily \\nat the patient’s request, a cast metal inlay (or porcelain \\ninlay) could be used to replace lost tooth contour.\\nThe preparation for a class V composite restora-\\ntion is usually kept as conservative as possible (Fig. \\n10-40B), with a convex axial wall that is just into den-\\ntin (Fig. 10-39C) and little or no extension for preven-\\ntion. Prevention of future caries occurs through patient \\neducation in oral hygiene techniques and from periodic \\nFIGURE 10-37.

The core restoration that replaces tooth \\nstructure prior to preparing a tooth for a crown may \\nbe called a restoration under crown (RUC) or amalgam \\nunder crown (AUC).

The post is necessary to provide retention. This \\nrestoration is called a cast post and core (Fig. 10-41).\\nOn posterior teeth, a crown will sometimes be con-\\nstructed entirely of cast metal and is called a complete\\ncast metal crown  (Fig. 10-42). To prepare a tooth for \\na complete crown, the previously restored anatomic \\ntooth crown (or prepared core) is externally reduced \\nwith diamond burs to make room for the required \\nthickness of the cast metal crown.

They occur in 0.3 to 3.8% of the popula-\\ntion.\\n7 They are found in both permanent and primary \\ndentitions, with 90% of all occurrences in the maxilla.8\\nSpecifically , the most frequent supernumerary speci-\\nmens are found in one of two locations: maxillary inci-\\nsor area or maxillary third molar region.

MANDIBULAR PREMOLAR AREA\\nThe most common location for supernumerary teeth in \\nthe mandible is between the first and second premolar \\nregions (Fig. 11-7). Supernumerary teeth appearing in \\nthis area generally resemble normal premolars in size \\nand shape.\\n13\\nExtra teeth may also form in other locations in the \\nmouth. For example, a most unusual instance of three \\nmandibular central incisors is seen in the radiograph in \\nFigure 11-8.\\nFIGURE 11-8.

ABNORMAL CROWN MORPHOLOGY\\nCrown malformations may be seen clinically upon \\nvisual inspection of the oral cavity.\\n1. THIRD MOLAR MALFORMATIONS\\nMaxillary third molars have the most variable crown \\nshape of all permanent teeth followed by mandibu-\\nlar thirds. These anomalies can range in shape from a \\nsmall peg-shaped crown to a multicusped, malformed \\nversion of either the first or second molar.\\n2. PEG-SHAPED LATERAL INCISORS\\nThe most common anomaly in tooth shape in the ante-\\nrior region of the secondary dentition is the peg-shaped\\n(or cone-shaped) lateral incisor  ( Fig. 11-9 ) (which \\noccur in 1 to 2% of the population).\\n4 The tooth is some-\\nwhat conical in shape and broadest cervically and tapers \\ntoward the incisal to a blunt point. Several studies of \\nidentical twins seem to indicate that missing and peg-\\nshaped lateral incisor teeth may be varied expressions \\nof the same genetic trait.\\n14,15 A most unusual occur-\\nrence is that of peg-shaped maxillary central incisors \\n(Fig. 11-10). Recall that peg-shaped teeth develop from \\none lobe instead of the four lobes, which are normal for \\nanterior teeth.\\n3. GEMINATION OR TWINNING\\nGemination  or twinning results from the splitting (or \\ntwinning) of a single forming tooth. Since the tooth \\ndivision is incomplete, the twinned crown appears \\ndoubled in width compared to a single tooth and pos-\\nsibly notched ( Fig. 11-11 ). The single root is not split \\nand has a common pulp canal . If the doubled tooth is \\ncounted as two teeth, the dental arch containing the \\ngeminated tooth will have an extra tooth beyond the \\nnormal number of teeth. It occurs more frequently in \\nthe primary dentition than in the permanent denti-\\ntion and most commonly in the region of the max-\\nillary incisors and canines.\\n3 (Gemination occurs in \\n<1% of the population.) Note in Figure 11-12  that the \\nwide, notched crowns of the anterior maxillary teeth \\nof this Native American resemble teeth that have \\ngeminated.\\n4. FUSION\\nFusion is the union of two adjacent tooth germs, always \\ninvolving the dentin . Upon clinical examination, this \\ncondition appears similar to gemination since the fused \\nteeth have one crown that appears doubled in width. \\nHowever, unlike gemination, radiographs usually \\nreveal two separate but fused roots (seen in Fig. 11-13\\nABNORMAL TOOTH MORPHOLOGYSECTION III'),\n",

Another way to differen-\\ntiate fusion from gemination is to count the teeth in \\nthe arch. If the fused teeth are counted as two, the total \\nnumber of teeth will reflect the normal number of teeth \\nin that arch ( Fig. 11-14). Like geminated teeth, fused \\nteeth occur more commonly in the anterior portion of \\nthe mouth (but in <1% of the population) and more \\noften in the primary dentition than in the permanent \\ndentition. The mandibular incisor area is affected more \\noften than the maxilla.\\n2,3\\nIt is thought that fusion is caused by pressure or \\nforce during development of adjacent roots. Many of \\nthe reports of fusion involve a supernumerary tooth \\njoining with an adjacent tooth, such as the fusion of a \\nmandibular third and fourth molar seen in Figure 11-15,\\nor the fusion of a maxillary lateral incisor and anterior \\nsupernumerary tooth.\\n16–18\\n5. HUTCHINSON’S INCISORS \\nAND MULBERRY MOLARS\\nWhen an infected mother passes syphilis on to her \\nunborn baby, the child’s teeth in both dentitions may \\ndevelop with unusual shapes. Maxillary and mandibular \\nincisors may be screwdriver shaped, broad cervically, \\nand narrowing incisally, with a notched incisal edge. \\nThese teeth are referred to as Hutchinson’s incisors .\\nNote in Figure 11-16A that the crowns of Hutchinson’s \\nincisors resemble somewhat the notched crowns of \\nfused incisors seen in Figure 11-14. Also, first molars \\nin these dentitions may have occlusal anatomy made up \\nof multiple tiny tubercles with poorly developed indis-\\ntinguishable cusps. Because of the berry-like shape on \\nthe occlusal surfaces, these molars are called mulberry\\nmolars (Fig. 11-16B). Other manifestations of congeni-\\ntal syphilis may include scarring of the skin around the \\nmouth, bone pain, and swelling of the joints.\\nFIGURE 11-12. Deep labial grooves on all four maxillary \\n central incisors and four canines (maxillary and mandibular) of a \\nNative American. Notice the similarity in morphology of these \\nwide, grooved incisor crowns with the crowns of geminated teeth.\\nFIGURE 11-13. Fusion.

If the tooth that is twice as wide as \\nit should be is counted as two, the number of incisors is four \\n(four arrows)—the expected number. Therefore, we suspect that \\nthe maxillary right lateral and central incisor have fused. Another \\npossibility is the fusion of the central incisor and a supernumer-\\nary mesiodens, and the lateral incisor is congenitally absent. \\nB.

Frequently , \\nthe cusp has a pulp horn so that on a radiograph it may \\nbe mistaken for a supernumerary tooth superimposed \\nover an anterior tooth, or a dens in dente (described \\nlater in this chapter).

TAURODONTIA\\nIn taurodontia, or so-called bull or prism teeth, the \\npulp chamber is very long, without a constriction \\nnear the cementoenamel junction ( Fig. 11-25 ). This \\noccurs only in permanent teeth (with a frequency of \\n<1 in 1000 among American Indians and some Arctic \\npopulations).\\n25 Taurodontia is caused by a disorganiza-\\ntion of the calcified tissues and possibly occurs in den-\\ntitions subjected to heavy use.\\n3. DILACERATION\\nDilaceration [die lass er A shun] is a severe bend \\nor angular distortion of a tooth root ( Fig. 11-26 ).26\\nThis unusual occurrence may be the result of a trau-\\nmatic injury or of insufficient space for development, \\nas is often the case with third molars ( Fig. 11-27 ).\\nDilaceration is often observed in teeth with accessory \\nroots. Historically, flexion is another term that has \\nbeen used to describe a sharp curvature or bend of a \\ntooth root.\\n4. DENS IN DENTE\\nDens in dente  (literally “tooth within a tooth”) is a \\ndevelopmental anomaly resulting from the invagina-\\ntion of the enamel organ within the crown of a tooth \\n(seen in Fig. 11-28A).

On a \\nradiograph, dens in dente appears as a mass of elon-\\ngated enamel within the dentin of a normal-sized tooth \\n(Fig. 11-28B). Usually, it appears in the coronal third of \\nthe tooth but may extend the entire root length.

(Their occurrence is \\nfrom 1 to 5% of the population.2)\\n5. CONCRESCENCE\\nConcrescence [kon KRES ens] involves the superficial \\nfusion or growing together of only the cementum of \\ntwo adjacent tooth roots ( Fig. 11-29 ). Unlike fusion, \\nthese teeth usually become joined after eruption into \\nthe oral cavity due to the close proximity of the roots \\nand excessive cementum deposition.\\n6 This anomaly \\noccurs most frequently in the maxillary molar region.\\n6. DWARFED ROOTS\\nMaxillary teeth often exhibit normal-sized crowns with \\nabnormally dwarfed (short) roots (seen in Fig. 11-22B). \\nThe incisal edges of maxillary teeth with dwarfed roots \\nare often displaced lingually (as also occurs on man-\\ndibular incisors). This condition is often hereditary; \\nhowever, isolated or generalized dwarfing of roots may \\nalso result from orthodontic movement of the teeth \\n(with braces) when the movement has occurred too \\nrapidly .\\n7. HYPERCEMENTOSIS\\nHypercementosis is the excessive formation of cemen-\\ntum around the root of a tooth after the tooth has \\nerupted (Fig. 11-30). It may be caused by trauma, meta-\\nbolic dysfunction, or periapical inflammation. Excess \\ncementum may actually form a thin layer that connects \\nadjacent roots, similar to the thin tissue that connects \\nthe “toes” on the webbed foot of a duck.\\n8. EXTRA (ACCESSORY) ROOTS\\nUsually occurring in teeth whose roots form after birth, \\naccessory roots are probably caused by trauma, meta-\\nbolic dysfunction, or pressure.

First, the \\nsuffix “-plasia” refers to formation or development. \\nDysplasia is a generic term that indicates abnormal \\ndevelopment. Dysplasia can result from too little min-\\neral content being incorporated ( hypomineralization )\\nor too little calcium ( hypocalcification ) incorporated \\ninto enamel or dentin. Hypoplasia is a form of dyspla-\\nsia that refers to an incomplete formation of a  tissue. \\nDysplasia of the enamel or dentin can result from a \\nnumber of factors during tooth formation, such as \\ntaking in too much  fluoride, administration of tetra-\\ncycline antibiotic, congenital syphilis, or injury to the \\ntooth.\\n1. ENAMEL DYSPLASIA\\nEnamel dysplasia is a term used to describe a distur-\\nbance in the enamel-forming cells (ameloblasts) dur-\\ning early enamel formation . Enamel dysplasia may be \\nhereditary (as with amelogenesis imperfecta) or could \\nresult from systemic causes during early tooth for-\\nmation (such as exposure to a high fever, nutritional \\ndeficiencies, or an excess amount  of fluoride) or local \\ndisturbances (such as trauma or periapical infection). \\nGenerally, variations in color (from white to yellow \\nand brown) or variations in morphology (such as pit-\\nting or roughened enamel) can result. Several examples \\nof enamel disturbances are presented here.\\na. Amelogenesis Imperfecta\\nAmelogenesis imperfecta [ah mel o JEN e sis im per \\nFEC ta] is a hereditary disorder that affects the enamel \\nformation of both dentitions (Fig. 11-39). (“Amelo-” refers \\nto the ameloblasts or enamel-forming cells, and “genesis” \\nFIGURE 11-36. Switched positions for the permanent left \\nmaxillary lateral incisor and canine.\\nFIGURE 11-37.

The word \\n“imperfecta” means imperfect.) The partial or complete \\nlack of enamel results in rough yellow to brownish crowns \\nthat are susceptible to decay. This condition is rare (with \\nan incidence in the United States of 1 in 15,000\\n2).\\nb. Fluorosis\\nFluorosis is a condition caused during enamel forma-\\ntion by the ingestion of a high concentration of fluo-\\nride compounds in drinking water that greatly exceeds\\nthe concentration recommended for controlling decay. \\nThe amount of fluoride compounds in some naturally \\noccurring mineral water that causes this condition is \\nmany times greater than the one part per million that is \\nadded to drinking water to effectively reduce the preva-\\nlence of decay. If during enamel formation, teeth that \\nare forming their crowns are exposed to excessively \\nhigh concentrations of ingested fluoride, the tooth can \\nexhibit a color change from white to yellow/brown \\nspots called mottled enamel , and if severe, the tooth \\nenamel can undergo a morphologic change result-\\ning in the formation of pits within the enamel ( pitted\\nenamel) (seen on erupting secondary central incisors \\nin Fig 11-40 ). Clinically, all permanent teeth may be \\ninvolved depending on the length of time that the per-\\nson was ingesting high levels of fluoride. These teeth \\nare most often resistant to decay.\\nc. Enamel Damage Due to High Fever\\nPitted enamel on permanent teeth may result from a \\nvery high fever during early childhood due to diseases \\nsuch as measles.\\n4 Usually, the tooth crowns that are \\ndeveloping at the time of the fever are affected. For \\nexample, the damage to the crowns of the permanent \\nsecond molars as well as the permanent second pre-\\nmolars of the person in Figure 11-41  resulted from a \\nhigh fever at about age 2 years and 3 months when the \\nenamel was forming on both the mandibular second \\npremolar and second molar.\\nd. Focal Hypoplasia (or Hypomaturation)\\nFocal hypoplasia  is an incomplete development of \\nenamel seen as a localized discolored spot or deformed \\narea on a tooth. During enamel formation, this con-\\ndition may result from trauma, a local infection of an \\nadjacent abscessed primary tooth, or some other inter-\\nference in enamel matrix maturation, most likely to \\noccur in succedaneous teeth (called a Turner’s tooth)\\nseen in Figure 11-42 . Unlike decalcification (early \\ndecay), which can usually be seen in the cervical thirds \\nof teeth or on occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth, this \\nFIGURE 11-40. Fluorosis. This condition is most evident on \\nthe maxillary and mandibular central incisors. It is seen as white \\n coloration or mottling of color, and some pitting (on partially \\nerupted tooth No. 9).

The underlying enamel may be soft making \\nthe area susceptible to decay.\\n2. DENTIN DYSPLASIA\\nDysplasias of dentin occur twice as often as those in \\nenamel (1 in 8000). 39 Abnormal development of the \\ndentin includes conditions with hereditary and sys-\\ntemic causes as follows.\\na. Dentinogenesis Imperfecta\\nDentinogenesis [den ti no JEN e sis] imperfecta is a \\nhereditary disorder that affects the dentin formation of \\nboth dentitions. Clinically, all teeth have an unesthetic \\nlight blue-gray to yellow, somewhat opalescent appear-\\nance (Fig. 11-43A), hence the term hereditary opales-\\ncent dentin. On a radiograph, there may be a partial\\nor total absence of pulp chambers and root canals \\nsince the pulp chambers and root canals may calcify \\n(Fig. 11-43B ). These teeth may be weak because of a \\nlack of support in the dentin, so they may be suscep-\\ntible to severe attrition.\\nb. Tetracycline Stain\\nWhen the antibiotic tetracycline is taken by a pregnant \\nwoman, an infant, or a child during the time of tooth \\nformation and calcification, it can affect developing \\ndentin. The result is a change in tooth color depend-\\ning on the dose of the drug, to a yellow or gray-brown \\n(Fig. 11-44). The resultant staining may be generalized \\nin the primary dentition but may also affect some per-\\nmanent teeth, depending on the age at which tetracy-\\ncline was administered. Since only the teeth that are \\ncalcifying during the tetracycline therapy are stained, \\nit is possible to confirm this condition by noting the \\nage when tetracycline was given and comparing this to \\nthe teeth that were calcifying at that age. Some persons \\nhave erroneously blamed the staining from tetracycline \\nantibiotic therapy during tooth formation on fluori-\\ndated community drinking water, which is beneficial \\nfor both teeth and general health.\\nE. CHANGES IN TOOTH SHAPE DUE \\nTO INJURY AFTER TOOTH ERUPTION\\nReactions to injury are not really anomalies but are \\nunique changes in tooth morphology associated with a \\nspecific cause. It is important to recognize these condi-\\ntions so that their etiology (causes) can be identified \\nFIGURE 11-43. Dentinogenesis imperfecta (opalescent den-\\ntin) is a hereditary disorder that affects the dentin and external \\nappearance of all teeth. This condition occurs only once in every \\n8000 people. A.

ATTRITION\\nAttrition is the wearing away of enamel (and eventu-\\nally dentin) due to the movement of mandibular teeth \\nagainst maxillary teeth during normal function and \\nis made worse by excessive grinding together of teeth \\nknown as bruxism. Two examples of severe attrition \\nare shown in Figure 11-45. Stress greatly increases brux-\\nism. Attrition should be distinguished from other forms \\nof tooth damage such as abrasion and erosion since the \\ncause of each condition, and therefore the therapy to \\nprevent further damage, is quite different. Recall from \\nthe discussion on bruxism in Chapter 9 (Occlusion) \\nthat normal tooth-to-tooth contacts per day in a healthy \\nperson without occlusal problems may be as little as \\n7 to 8 min/d during mastication of food with a force \\nthat is normally less than 33 pounds. Imagine, on the \\nother hand, the potential damage to teeth (as well as \\nmuscles and the TMJ) if a bruxer bites together for \\n5 hours per night at pressures exceeding 190 pounds!\\n2. ABRASION\\nThe wearing away of tooth structure by mechanical \\nmeans is called abrasion. A common example of abra-\\nsion (sometimes called toothbrush abrasion) results in \\nthe loss of enamel near the cementoenamel junction \\nof the facial surfaces of crowns, especially on premo-\\nlars and canines, due to improper tooth brushing tech-\\nniques (Fig. 11-46). It can be caused by using a hard \\nbristle toothbrush, a horizontal brushing stroke, and/\\nor a gritty dentifrice. Another contributing factor to the \\nFIGURE 11-45. Attrition results from prolonged bruxism or \\ngrinding of the teeth. A. The anterior teeth have been worn \\ndown almost to the gingival sulcus. B. The permanent mandibu-\\nlar incisors are worn down to a level where the pulp chamber \\nhad been at one time many years previously. (Note the darker \\ncircular and oval areas of exposed secondary or reparative den-\\ntin visible on the incisal ridges.)\\nA\\nB\\nFIGURE 11-46. Abrasion (sometimes called toothbrush abra-\\nsion) is due in part to incorrect horizontal tooth brushing over \\nareas of cementum that are exposed due to the recession of the \\ngingiva. Flexing of the teeth during heavy occlusal forces and \\nsubsequent enamel loss (called abfraction) may contribute to \\nand appear similar to abrasion.\\nFIGURE 11-47. Erosion. Severe erosion is evident on the lin-\\ngual surfaces of these maxillary teeth, especially the anterior \\nteeth. This pattern of tooth destruction is typically associated \\nwith someone with severe acid reflux, or repeated regurgitation \\nin bulimic persons. Note the exposure of one pulp chamber on \\ntooth No. 10. (Courtesy of Carl Allen, D.D.S., M.S.D.) Erosion \\nof facial enamel may be caused by holding pieces of acidic fruit \\nlike lemons next to the teeth and sucking on them for an \\nextended period of time, a habit practiced by some persons in \\nSoutheast Asia.'),\n",

This condition is thought to result in \\nloss of tooth structure due to separation of enamel rods \\nnear the CEJ.\\nOcclusal abrasion results from chewing or biting \\nhard foods or objects, or from chewing tobacco and \\nresults in flattened cusps on all posterior teeth and \\nworn incisal edges (appearing similar to attrition). An \\nunusual type of abrasion, caused by the use for many \\nyears of a toothpick between the maxillary central inci-\\nsors, has been reported by Melfi.\\n40 The same type of \\nproximal abrasion has been reported from the use of a \\nstraight pin for the same purpose over many years.\\n3. EROSION\\nErosion is the loss of tooth structure from chemical (not \\nmechanical) means and affects smooth and occlusal \\nsurfaces. Erosion can be the result of excessive intake \\nor use of citric acid (like in lemons), carbonated bever-\\nages, or the result of regurgitated stomach acids (seen \\nin bulimic individuals who habitually induce vomiting, \\nas in the “binge and purge” syndrome).\\n2 Erosion can \\nalso occur from an unknown cause (idiopathic). Severe \\nerosion of the lingual enamel of all maxillary anterior \\nteeth is evident in Figure 11-47. Careful inspection of \\nthe tooth damage evident in the figure reveals that at \\nleast one pulp horn has been exposed on the maxillary \\nleft lateral incisor.\\nF. UNUSUAL DENTITIONS\\nCareful examination of the casts of the dentition of a \\n23-year-old man reveals that the mandibular left first \\nmolar closely resembles a maxillary first molar, com-\\nplete with what appears to be an oblique ridge and a \\ncusp of Carabelli ( Fig. 11-48).

Forensic jurisprudence  involves criminal and \\ncivil lawyers using the earlier described special-\\nists, reports, and testimony to pursue their case in \\nour system of justice.\\n10. Forensic odontology  is divided into five major \\nareas: (a) human dental identification, (b) mass \\ndisaster human dental identification, (c) bite \\nmark analysis, (d) human abuse, and (e) legal \\nissues such as the standard of care considerations \\nin personal injury cases.\\nDENTISTRY AND HUMAN IDENTIFICATIONSECTION II\\nTeeth are the most durable parts of the body , and den-\\ntitions are as individual as fingerprints. Therefore, \\nindividual tooth morphology as well as the restora-\\ntions that exist in teeth are useful for human identifi-\\ncation. Situations involving decomposition and skeletal \\nremains may yield no recognizable facial features or \\nfingerprints. Postmortem (after death) teeth, jaws, \\nprostheses, and appliances can yield a positive identifi-\\ncation, given the existence and accuracy of antemortem \\n(before death) records. Even DNA, a popular and valu-\\nable identification tool, relies on accurate and complete \\nantemortem (before death) records. Therefore, accu-\\nrate, comprehensive, and current radiographs and den-\\ntal charting are critical to the successful confirmation \\nor elimination of an individual as a victim.\\nEven with the lack of antemortem records, evalua-\\ntion of the dentition is a worthwhile aid for investiga-\\ntors to provide information regarding the age, sex, and \\nestimated socioeconomic (sometimes called race or \\ncultural heritage) grouping. This information is derived \\nfrom tooth and dental arch morphology and anatomy , \\nrestorative materials, attrition patterns, periodontal \\nstatus, eruption patterns, skeletal features, and serology \\n(the study of body fluids like blood).\\nForensic dental techniques most commonly include \\ncollection and preservation of dental and jaw remains, \\ndental radiographs, photographs, impressions and \\ncasts, antemortem and postmortem charting, and the \\ncomparison of these records. Points of comparison \\n(specific features) include (a) the number, class, and \\ntype of teeth; (b) tooth rotation, spacing, and malposi-\\ntion; (c) anomalies and general morphology (Fig. 12-1);\\n(d) restorations (Fig. 12-2) and prostheses or appliances \\n(Fig. 12-3 ); (e) caries and other pathology (in some \\nsituations); (f) endodontic treatment; (g) implants and \\nsurgical repairs; (h) bony trabecular patterns; and (i) \\nocclusion, erosion, and attrition.\\nDNA can be recovered from periodontal and pul-\\npal tissues, as well as the hard tissues, of the teeth. \\nAlthough DNA analysis has become an important \\ntool in the forensic science armamentaria, its limita-\\ntions include high costs and lengthy processing times. \\nAnd like all methods, the use of DNA requires ante-\\nmortem  information. A DNA collection kit is shown'),\n",

All of the techniques and careful comparisons \\ndescribed previously are useful.\\nDentists and other health caregivers have a respon-\\nsibility to report suspected abuse and neglect  of their \\npatients by others. This includes recognition and dif-\\nferentiation of the signs, symptoms, and body areas \\ninvolved in accidents compared to the injuries that are \\nsustained by a child, a spouse (male or female), or an \\nelderly or disabled individual. One abuse scenario is \\ndescribed here. A young adult male brought his girl-\\nfriend into the dental office for emergency treatment \\nof several broken front teeth and lacerated lips. The \\nwoman was silent while the man related an accident \\nas the cause of the injuries. The man insisted on being \\npresent during the treatment and was evasive about \\nanswering questions. As required by all state laws, the \\nsituation was reported immediately to the appropriate \\nlaw enforcement agency. The dentist’s suspicions had \\nbeen aroused sufficiently regarding the incongruity of \\nthe story and the injuries sustained. Toward the end of \\ntreatment, the police arrived, and the man was arrested. \\nRadiographs, the dental record, and the dentist’s testi-\\nmony were critical since the victim was fearful of future \\nrevenge from her abuser. Injuries the dentist might \\nobserve include fractured bones and teeth, bruises, lac-\\nerations, and bite marks.\\nNeglecting dental pathology is also a reportable \\nand potentially criminal offense. As often seen by this \\nauthor, children may not be taken to a dentist for treat-\\nment of dental caries. This can result in pain and infec-\\ntion and, in some cases, may result in the loss of all \\nteeth at an early age (Fig. 12-7).\\nBITE MARKSSECTION IV\\nBite marks  are in the category described as pattern \\ninjuries. Pattern injuries can result from teeth, belt \\nbuckles, and other blunt objects such as a hammer or \\npipe. Homicides and assault and battery cases have been \\nsolved by bite mark identification, analysis, and com-\\nparison. Many bites are severe and leave telltale marks \\nlong after an assault. One of several techniques of com-\\nparison and analysis is shown here, comparing bite \\nmark tracings to the tooth imprint pattern tracings of \\nthe suspect or defendant. Dental casts and photographs \\nfrom the suspect or suspects are made after obtaining a \\ncourt-ordered search warrant (Fig. 12-8A and B).\\nIn all cases of bite mark analysis, the forensic dentist \\nmust have a thorough knowledge and understanding of \\ntooth morphology, occlusion, dental arch characteris-\\ntics, and the physiology of jaw function. Teeth that are \\nmalpositioned, not in occlusion, fractured, or restored \\nmay not leave the same mark on a victim as teeth that \\nare in ideal alignment. This deviation from normal (or \\ndifferences from one suspect to another) could benefit \\nthe forensic dentist in analysis and identification.\\nAlthough these techniques can be useful in solving \\nsome child abuse cases, assaults, and homicide, bite \\nmarks cannot generally be used to a level of absolute \\ncertainty in suspect identification. A potential suspect is \\neither “ruled out or eliminated” as the perpetrator of the \\ncrime or “included” as a suspect (see Fig. 12-8C and D). \\nAdditional evidence is usually required to obtain a firm \\nconviction. However, in this author’s experience, sus-\\npects often admit their guilt prior to trial when faced \\nwith a forensic dentist who would testify in court \\nregarding the bite mark.\\nPhotography can be used to assist bite mark identifi-\\ncation. Color and black-and-white film photography is \\nstill the standard, but digital photography has become \\nfairly well accepted. The use of infrared photography \\ncan be used to identify subcutaneous evidence of dam-\\nage from a bite mark that is not visible on the surface of \\nthe skin. Ultraviolet photography can serve to depict a \\nbite mark in an area with extraneous other marks such \\nas tattoos and skin damage.\\nThe forensic dentist must first establish the mark as \\na human bite mark, and then identify , if possible, the \\nteeth involved in the mark. Aberrations include teeth \\nthat are missing, extruded (supererupted), hypo-\\nerupted or ankylosed, rotated (torsiversion), tilted, \\nchipped, and anomalous. The chapter in this text on \\nanomalies should be reason enough to remain open-\\nminded and diligent when considering bite marks! \\nThe dental forensic examiner must also consider \\nthe possibility of animal bites, victim self-bites, and \\nmarks from foreign objects that might be mistaken for \\na bite mark. Separate analysis of those markings may \\nbe useful to law enforcement agencies by connecting \\nthe victim’s injuries to a tool or instrument owned by \\na suspect.\\nA bite mark may also provide DNA evidence of \\nthe perpetrator of the crime. Techniques are available \\nto obtain this information. Today , when DNA can be \\ncollected, amplified, and analyzed with the standard \\naccepted modern methods (e.g., polymerase chain \\nreaction [PCR)] of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA), it \\nis possible to quantify the numerical probability of the \\nassociation between the biter and the bite mark injury .'),\n",

Most of us vividly recall the mass disaster \\nthat occurred on September 11, 2001 at the World Trade \\nCenter in New York City as well as at the Pentagon \\nand in Pennsylvania. However, there are many natu-\\nral disasters that cause mass fatalities. These include \\nthe August and September 2005 hurricanes (Katrina, \\nRita, and Wilma) affecting the Gulf Coast of the United \\nStates, the December 2004 tsunami in Indonesia and \\nthe Indian Ocean, and other hurricanes, earthquakes, \\nfloods, and tornados. Man-made mass disasters include \\nthe various forms of terrorist acts, armed conflicts, \\nbuilding collapses, large freeway motor vehicle acci-\\ndents, industrial accidents, airplane crashes, and train \\nwrecks. Mass disasters cannot be predicted with any \\naccuracy, but they will certainly continue to happen in \\nour immediate future and beyond.\\nThe role of the forensic dentist in mass disasters is \\nprimarily to identify human remains. Knowledge of \\ndental anatomy is crucial to this role. Human fatalities \\nin mass disasters can number from a relative handful \\nof individuals to thousands or hundreds of thousands. \\nManagement of small disasters can be relatively easily \\nmanaged while larger disasters are more complex. The \\nmanagement of any size disaster will necessarily include \\nconsiderations for harmful chemicals or other biologic \\nagents (such as in bioterrorism). The dentist must be \\nable to coordinate and function well in these situations \\nfrom the initial occurrence of the disaster. This requires \\nthat the forensic dentist and the dental team are well \\ntrained, led by experienced individuals, and completely \\nintegrated into the operation.\\nA. PREPARATION AND TRAINING\\nA forensic dental team must be trained at the individ-\\nual level and as a team. The Armed Forces Institute of \\nPathology (AFIP) course is the premier international \\ntraining course held annually in Bethesda, Maryland \\n(http://www .afip.org). The Southwest Symposium is \\noffered biannually in June at the University of Texas Health \\nSciences Center at San Antonio (http://www .uthscsa.\\nedu). Additionally , the American Society of Forensic \\nOdontology (http://www .asfo.org) offers annual train-\\ning and scientific programs and information on other \\ncourses nationally and internationally . All forensic den-\\ntists and teams who were initially called to New York \\nCity for the World Trade Center attack on November \\n9, 2001 were required to be AFIP trained and/or \\nboard certified by the American Board of Forensic \\nOdontology .\\nB. INITIAL RESPONSE\\nIn the event of a mass disaster, local law enforcement \\nagencies and emergency medical teams respond first. \\nLegal authority and jurisdiction are by the legal entity \\nsuch as city or county in which the disaster occurs. \\nRescue of injured individuals is the first priority for \\nemergency medical services (EMS) personnel. Site secu-\\nrity is the first priority for the law enforcement agency.'),\n",

Responding agencies \\nmay include the National Transportation and Safety \\nBoard (NTSB), the Federal Emergency Management \\nAgency (FEMA), the Disaster Mortuary Operational \\nResponse Team (DMORT), the Federal Bureau of \\nInvestigation (FBI), the National Disaster Medical \\nSystem (NDMS), the Department of Homeland Security , \\nand related state agencies.\\nIt is critical for a dentist to be available at the disaster \\nsite to identify human remains and dental components \\nof human remains that may not be recognizable by a \\nnon–dental-trained person. There should be a dentist \\nonsite during the entire operation of search and recov-\\nery. Obviously, the knowledge of dental anatomy is \\ncritical to this aspect. A general recommendation is to \\nhave a forensic dentist accompany each body recovery \\nteam to ascertain that all relevant dental information \\nnecessary for identification is retained in a useful and \\ntrackable manner. All body parts are initially flagged \\non site and in situ, then photographed in place prior to \\nremoval. Extreme burn cases may require stabilization \\nof the dentition with a spray lacquer such as polyure-\\nthane or even hair spray. This will stabilize the fragile \\ndental evidence from damage during transport.\\nAll body parts are given separate identification num-\\nbers, which will often mean that several parts of a single \\nindividual’s dentition may possess different and unique \\nidentifiers that will ultimately be connected to a single \\nidentified body. In New York City after the World Trade \\nCenter disaster, as many as 200 individually identified \\nand numbered body parts were later associated with \\na single victim. A single tooth found separated from a \\nportion of a jaw or body would have a different number \\nthan the jaw part from which it is later associated. An \\nappropriate tracking method is used to locate within \\nthe site grid and diagram the original location of each \\nbody and part. Aspects of this process can be used later \\nin the forensic determination of cause and method of \\nprogression of the disaster event.\\nC. MORGUE AND FORENSIC DENTAL \\nIDENTIFICATION OPERATIONS\\nThe dental section of the morgue operation is divided \\ninto three major components: antemortem examina-\\ntion, postmortem examination, and a comparison of \\neach. Each of the three major sections has two foren-\\nsic dentists. There is a minimum of one experienced \\nforensic dentist in each of the teams. A team leader \\ngenerally functions in a supervisory capacity as a shift \\ncommander. There are usually additional secretarial \\nsupport personnel for overall coordination. Figure 12-9\\ndepicts the dental radiographs and actual dissected \\njaws with dentition used to identify an actual aircraft \\nincident victim for which a dental identification was \\nrequired.\\nA critical component for dental identification proce-\\ndures is the computer-based WinID program developed \\nby Dr. James McGivney. An example of the document \\nused for gathering information for this program is seen \\nin Figure 12-9D. It is a database program that utilizes \\nspecific codes of antemortem and postmortem dental \\nfindings and identifies records that have a possible \\nidentification match. The forensic dental team then \\nexamines hardcopy records for final verification. This \\nprogram can be downloaded at no cost from http://\\nwww.winid.com.\\nThe personnel in charge of antemortem records\\nobtain antemortem dental records from dentists of \\nlikely victims. These records must include copies of all \\ndental chart information and notations, as well as origi-\\nnal dental radiographs that are identified by name, date, \\nand position (left, right, etc.). The antemortem team \\nverifies and inputs this information into the WinID \\nprogram to create a digital database.\\nThe dental radiographs alone are not adequate to \\ncomplete antemortem charting. One must also consider \\nthe time span between antemortem information and the \\npresumed time of death. Additional dentists may have \\nprovided dental care, and therefore, additional ante-\\nmortem records may exist. The dental chart must be \\nreviewed in detail to determine what additional resto-\\nrations or other treatments (such as extractions) were \\nprovided subsequent to the date of the radiographs. For \\nexample, even though there is no antemortem radio-\\ngraphic evidence of a new mesio-occlusal amalgam, the \\npostmortem charting can still be considered consistent \\nwith the antemortem radiographs if the radiographs \\nwere obtained prior to the placement of this more recent \\nrestoration, and if all other findings match. A paper \\nrecord is filed in the antemortem file area. (See Fig. 12-2 \\nfor a comparison of antemortem and postmortem radio-\\ngraphs to illustrate the changes that can occur between \\nthe antemortem and postmortem radiographs.)\\nDental records could be provided in a language \\nother than English, so translation may be necessary. \\nWhen reviewing the antemortem chart, it is impor-\\ntant, as noted earlier, to convert any numbering sys-\\ntems used by the dentist of record (Palmer, FDI, etc.) \\nto the Universal numbering system common in the \\nUnited States (numbered 1 to 32 for permanent teeth \\nand A to T for primary teeth). One should also be atten-\\ntive to esthetic treatments (composites, veneers, etc.) \\nthat could be missed on postmortem examination of \\nremains that are covered with debris or damaged by'),\n",

Finally, in reviewing dental records, \\nthe quality of the handwriting and/or completeness of \\nthe record may pose significant barriers to determining \\naccurate antemortem information.\\nA team of two forensic dentists performs a thorough \\npostmortem examination and then verifies each other \\nto reduce the chance of errors.

The victim’s condition is recorded pho-\\ntographically, radiographically, and in written notes \\nas received in the morgue area. The process of post-\\nmortem dental examination, both clinical and radio-\\ngraphic, must consider numerous factors. On clinical \\nexamination, the forensic personnel must prepare the \\nspecimens by careful cleaning of debris, with care taken \\nnot to destroy fragile tooth fragments or the relation of \\nteeth and tooth fragments to the rest of the dental arch. \\nThis is most critical in the burned victim.

In cases of individual identifica-\\ntions or the review of a few charts, this may be done \\nmanually. However, in large disasters, the use of a com-\\nparison program such as WinID is critical. In the man-\\nagement of a disaster on the scale of the World Trade \\nCenter disaster in 2001 involving the analysis of several \\nthousand antemortem records and over 1000 postmor-\\ntem dental examination records, WinID and computer-\\nized assistance are mandatory.\\nIn the comparison process, there are three outcomes \\npossible.

The forensic dentist is still required to visually\\ncompare the dental radiographs and other examination information to ascertain identity, which was “positive” in this case.\\nD'),\n",

All of these situations must be readily and \\nreliably explained.\\nFinal “sign-off” of the comparison is legally the respon-\\nsibility of a licensed dentist with appropriate forensic \\nodontology credentials.\\nD. FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY\\nAnother component of forensic identification may \\ninvolve determining the age, race (cultural heritage), \\nand sex of the victim. Age can be estimated in some \\ncases by the evaluation of the teeth, especially during \\nthe time of primary or mixed dentition as described \\nin detail in Chapter 6. Growth and development of \\nthe dentition are complete by about 18 years of age. \\nOnce all primary teeth are exfoliated and third molars \\nare fully developed, whether impacted or erupted, the \\nability to gauge age by dental development is no lon-\\nger reliable. Wear patterns and pulp chamber changes \\nsuch as pulp stones and pulpal recession are not accu-\\nrate. This author has worked with forensic cases where \\ndental wear and pulpal recession appeared to indicate \\na person of 35 to 50 years of age when in reality the \\nvictim was in the early 20s. In another homicide case, a \\nknown 21-year-old female presented with an impacted \\ntooth No. 16, which suggested a developmental age of \\n15 years, and an impacted tooth No. 17, which sug-\\ngested a developmental age of at least 18 (Fig. 12-10).\\nOther anthropologic aspects of the dentition can \\nprovide indicators of racial or cultural backgrounds. \\nShovel-shaped incisors may indicate a person of Asian \\nor Mongolian background. Other indicators of this \\nancestry include prominent zygomatic processes, mod-\\nerate prognathism, rotation of the incisors, buccal pit-\\nting, an elliptical dental arch form, a straight mandibular \\nborder, and a wide and vertical ascending ramus. The \\npresence of a cusp of Carabelli is most often an indi-\\ncator of Caucasian ancestry. Other traits of Caucasian \\nFIGURE 12-10. Dental aging can be variable as shown in this same homicide victim case depicted in Figure 12-3. The development \\nof the root of tooth No. 17 appears to be of a person around 15 years of age as shown in dental growth and development charts \\nelsewhere in this textbook. However, tooth No. 16 appears to be of an individual at least 18 years of age. The actual victim’s age was \\n20 years. Although dental growth, eruption patterns, tooth apex development, and closure patterns are well documented, the reality\\nof human variations can still be problematic in accurately assessing an individual’s age.'),\n",

On the July 17, \\n1996, off East Moriches, New York, TWA flight 800 \\n(a Boeing 747 aircraft) bound for Paris, France, exploded \\nwith 230 passengers aboard. Within the first 12 hours, \\na team of 30 dentists began the painstaking work of \\nidentifying the recovered bodies, which were devoid \\nof clothing. Two and a half weeks later, 208 of the 210 \\nrecovered bodies and body parts had been positively \\nidentified. Ninety-five bodies were identified by dental \\nrecords alone and another 60 by dental records along \\nwith medical records (radiographs, magnetic resonance \\nimages, etc.), medical anomalies, and fingerprints.\\nFor the first time ever, all relatives were screened \\nfor DNA samples to compare with the more than 400 \\nrecovered body parts, enabling the return of each to \\nthe families for an appropriate resting place. Nuclear \\nDNA samples were extracted from both bone and den-\\ntal pulps (which was all that remained after the first \\nweek). Mitochondrial DNA was also extracted from \\nground tooth structure, but it is only effective in match-\\ning maternal family connections. One victim was iden-\\ntified by examining DNA on toothbrushes in his home \\n(Columbus Dispatch, Columbus, Ohio, April 1, 1997) \\nsince, during tooth brushing, microscopic bits of tis-\\nsue from the gums and mucosa are scrubbed off and \\ncollect on the brush bristles. In all, seven people were \\nidentified by DNA alone because no other method was \\navailable.\\nOne month later, Norwegian researchers were able \\nto identify 139 of 141 people who died in a plane crash \\nin Spitsbergen, Norway, in August 1996 ( Journal of \\nNature Genetics , April 1997). They proved that 257 \\nrecovered body parts belonged to 141 people. They \\ncollected DNA samples from close relatives. When rela-\\ntives were not available, investigators collected DNA \\nfrom hairbrushes, dirty laundry, and toothbrushes in \\nthe victims’ homes.\\nOn September 11, 2001, both towers of the World \\nTrade Center in New York City were destroyed by ter-\\nrorist hijacked aircraft, and 2726 people were killed in \\nthe disaster, more than those who died at the attack of \\nPearl Harbor by the Japanese Navy in 1941. The den-\\ntal identification team consisted of over 200 dental per-\\nsonnel working for more than 1 year to identify bodies \\nand body parts by dental records. Approximately 50% \\nof all known victims (<1500) were identified, about \\nhalf of those by dental records and half by DNA means. \\nOn November 12, 2001, American Airlines flight 587 \\ncrashed in Queens on Long Island due to mechanical fail-\\nures and air turbulence.

However, this time-consuming method of \\ncopying teeth may have limited value in helping the \\nstudent to quickly sketch a tooth from memory for a \\nspecified view as might be expected during a conver-\\nsation with an instructor or a patient. Therefore, this \\nsection includes guidelines that can be useful for den-\\ntal and dental hygiene students when learning how to \\nquickly sketch a specific tooth and view from memory.\\nIn order to sketch a facial view of a recognizable \\ntooth from memory, the drawer must have knowledge \\nof the following characteristics related to the tooth \\nbeing drawn: (a) approximate crown-to-root ratio (i.e., \\nhow much longer is the root compared to the crown), \\n(b) approximate crown proportions (i.e., which is \\nwider: the crown width or its length), (c) location of \\nthe crown heights of contour (crests of curvature), (d) \\ncrown shape (taper, incisal edge shape or number and \\nrelative size of cusps, and cementoenamel junction \\n[CEJ] shape), and (e) root shape (taper and number \\nof roots) when drawing the entire tooth. If one consid-\\ners each of these tooth characteristics in the appropri-\\nate order, sketching a tooth becomes a relatively easy \\ntask and is an excellent exercise to apply all of the \\nknowledge of dental morphology that was presented in \\nSection I of this text: Comparative Tooth Anatomy.\\nAs an example, consider a sketch of a right maxillary \\ncentral incisor from the facial view. Follow along with \\nFigure 13-4 as you read about each step.\\nStep A : Consider the root-to-crown ratio. It is not \\nexpected that a student will remember the exact \\nratio of this tooth (1.16 to 1) but rather he or she \\nshould recall that all roots are normally longer than \\nthe crown. On maxillary central incisors, the root is \\nonly slightly longer than the crown. Based on this \\nfact, three parallel horizontal lines can be drawn to \\ndenote the distance of the crown length from incisal \\nedge to the cervical line relative to the root length \\nfrom cervical line to root apex (only slightly longer). \\nPosition the smaller crown length on top for the \\nmandibular teeth and on the bottom for maxillary \\nteeth. For this maxillary central incisor, the crown \\nlength is on the bottom.\\nStep B : Consider the proportions of the crown, that \\nis, the crown height (incisocervically) compared to \\nits width (mesiodistally). Again, you do not need \\nto memorize that the average crown width for this \\ntooth is 8.6 mm and its average length is 11.2 mm, \\nbut you should recall that the maxillary central inci-\\nsor crown is slightly longer than it is wide. Using this \\nline with the root axis line. Be sure that the tooth crown \\nis not tilted up or down. On the sides of the box, mark \\nthe places where you are going to locate the mesial and \\ndistal contact points of the crown. The incisal edge of \\nthe tooth will normally have a slight lingual twist of the \\ndistoincisal corner (not evident in Fig. 13-2) and will lie \\neither in the center of the box faciolingually or slightly \\nlingual to the center (in the same position it is shown \\non your drawings of the mesial and distal aspects). \\nThe cingulum is normally centered on, or slightly distal \\nto, the root axis line.\\nDo you find any straight lines (ruler-straight, that is) \\non any tooth other than those lines that have been pro-\\nduced by attrition? This would be most unusual.\\nUsing the same approach, you will be able to draw \\nother types of teeth. Labeling the grooves, the fossae, \\nand the ridges on the occlusal surfaces of the posterior \\nteeth will help to fix the morphology in your mind.\\nSKETCH TEETH RECOGNIZABLY FROM MEMORYSECTION II\\nFIGURE 13-4.

Extending these \\nvertical lines along the entire tooth length results in \\nthe formation of two boxes: a crown box that will \\nsurround the crown and a root box that will enclose \\nthe root. At this time, label the mesial (M) and distal \\n(D) surfaces of the crown box that is dependent on \\nwhether you are viewing a right or left incisor. For \\nthis right incisor, the mesial surface is on the right \\nside of the box, and the distal is on the left side, as if \\nyou were facing the patient.\\nStep C: Consider the heights of contour (crests of cur-\\nvature) on the mesial and distal surfaces. Since these \\ntwo points are the widest parts of the tooth crown \\nwhere the mesial and distal surfaces bulge out the \\nmost, they are therefore the points where the crown \\noutline touches the crown box established in the \\nprevious step. When the teeth are in ideal alignment, \\nthey are the location of the proximal contacts. On all \\nincisors, the proximal heights of contour (contacts) \\noccur in the incisal one third (EXCEPT on the distal \\nof a maxillary lateral incisor, which is in the middle \\nthird) and are located more incisally on the mesial \\nsurface than on the distal surface (EXCEPT on the \\nsymmetrical mandibular central incisor). With this \\nknowledge, a dot can be placed on the mesial and \\ndistal crown box outline at the appropriate levels. It \\nis not until this step is complete that you actually \\nbegin sketching the tooth crown shape (outline).\\nStep D: Begin sketching the crown outline. Use as many \\nof the criteria presented in the Appendix as you can \\nrecall in order to sketch a recognizable tooth. For \\nexample, on a maxillary central incisor, we know \\nthat the areas immediately surrounding all con-\\ntact areas are convex; mesial and distal crown walls \\ntaper slightly toward the root; and the incisal edge is \\nalmost flat or slightly convex and is a little shorter \\ntoward the distal. We also know that the cervical \\nline from the facial view is broad and curves toward \\nthe apex. Based on this knowledge, begin sketching \\nthe crown outline by placing subtle convexities that \\ntouch the crown box at the heights of contact points \\n(dots). These convexities blend apically to become \\nthe mesial and distal crown walls, and these walls \\nconverge (just slightly) toward the cervical line. The \\nproximal convexities also curve incisally to blend \\nwith the relatively straight incisal edge that touches \\nthe incisal line of the crown box in the mesial half and \\ntapers shorter (farther from the box outline) toward \\nthe distal. Finally , the cervical line appears as a con-\\ntinuation of the mesial and distal walls and curves \\ntoward the apex, just touching the cervical line of the \\ncrown box. If a sketch of the crown were all that you \\nare reproducing, you would be finished. If, however, \\nyou wish to add the root, proceed to the final step.\\nStep E: Sketch the root. We know that the apex of the \\nroot is near the center of the tooth root axis (a ver-\\ntical line in the center of the root at the cervix). \\nWe also know that roots are broadest in the cervical \\nthird (but not very much narrower than the width \\nof the crown), may be nearly parallel in the cervi-\\ncal third, and taper toward the rounded apex. Based \\non this knowledge, you can finish the sketch. Be \\naware that part of the root outline where it joins the \\nCEJ is actually visible within the crown box, and \\nthe rounded apex just touches the apical line of the \\nroot box.\\nWhen sketching other teeth from the facial views, use \\nsteps A through C as described earlier for developing the \\n“boxes” and crests of curvature, and refer to the Appendix \\npages for tooth traits when sketching the actual tooth \\noutlines. With practice, teeth can be sketched without \\nthe boxes in less than a minute while still maintaining the \\napproximate proportions and heights of contour. See \\nthe student sketch of a recognizable mandibular second \\nmolar from the buccal view in Figure 13-5A.\\nThe steps used to sketch the lingual view of all teeth \\nare the same as for the facial view EXCEPT the outline \\nis a mirror image of the facial view . Also, on this surface \\nof anterior teeth, there is normally evidence of a nar-\\nrower crown cingulum, marginal ridges, a lingual fossa, \\nand a cervical line that often includes a partial view of \\nthe proximal CEJ due to the taper of teeth toward the \\nlingual (as seen in Fig. 13-2, lingual view). On maxil-\\nlary molars, the lingual root is now in the foreground.\\nWhen sketching the proximal view of teeth, the first \\ntwo steps are similar to steps A and B above except that \\nthe crown outline box is developed for this view by using \\nthe faciolingual and inciso- or occluso-cervical crown \\nproportions. The facial crest of curvature is similar for all \\nteeth: in the cervical third. Lingually , the crest of curva-\\nture is in the cervical third on the cingulum for anterior \\nteeth but in the middle third for most posterior teeth. \\nDevelop a crown and root shape according to guidelines \\nin the Appendix. See the student sketch of a mandibular \\nsecond molar from the mesial view in Figure 13-5B.\\nPosterior teeth from the occlusal view are viewed \\nlooking directly down along the axis of the root. \\nCrown-to-root ratios do not apply from this view . The \\ncrown outline box is developed for this view by using \\nthe mesiodistal and faciolingual crown proportions. \\nOn mandibular premolars, the crown proportions are \\nslightly longer buccolingually than mesiodistally , but \\nclose to square.

Most premolars have a \\nmesial and distal pit connected by a groove running \\nmesiodistally between buccal and lingual cusps. Most \\nmolars (and three-cusped mandibular second premo-\\nlars) have three pits (mesial, central, and distal) that \\nare also connected by a groove passing mesiodistally \\nbetween buccal and lingual cusps. Molars also have one \\nor two buccal grooves that separate the two or three \\nbuccal cusps, respectively .

HOW TO CARVE A TOOTH\\nCarving a tooth helps you to see the tooth in three \\ndimensions and also to develop considerable manual \\nskill and dexterity . Examples of carvings by dental \\nhygiene students are shown in Figure 13-6 . While \\neventually you may be able to carve a tooth from a \\nblock of wax without preliminary measurement, the \\nbeginner can only do well by approaching the carving \\nsystematically in the same way you approached the \\ndrawings: first, by drawing a box on the wax block; \\nsecond, by sketching an outline of the tooth in the \\nbox; and third, by carving around the sketch or out-\\nline, one view or aspect at a time (sequence is shown \\nin Fig. 13-7).\\nWhen approaching the task of carving a tooth, con-\\nsider Michelangelo who conceived of his task of pro-\\nducing a marble statue by “liberating the figure from \\nthe marble that imprisons it.” And remember that he, \\ntoo, sometimes made mistakes and had to discard a \\nhalf-finished statue. The same can happen to your \\ntooth carving. To minimize this, as you cut away wax, \\nrepeatedly examine your carving from all sides; turn \\nit around and around and compare it with your speci-\\nmen from each view. Where it is too bulbous, the fault \\nis easily correctable by further reductions. Where too \\nmuch wax has been removed, you have one of three \\nchoices: add molten wax to the deficient region, make \\nthe entire carving proportionally smaller, or start with \\na new block of wax.\\nC. EXAMPLE: HOW TO CARVE A \\nMAXILLARY CENTRAL INCISOR \\nFROM A BLOCK OF WAX\\nUse the measurements you used for drawing. (Again, use \\nthe measurement of the buccal cusp on premolars for the \\ncrown length, and of the mesiobuccal cusp and mesiobuc-\\ncal or mesial root on molars for the root length.) This \\nconsistency of method prevents confusion. Allowance \\nis made for the greater length of some lingual cusps, \\nwhich are longer than the measured buccal cusp. Refer to \\nFigure 13-7 as you follow the following guidelines:\\nStep 1: Shave the sides of the block flat and make all \\nangles right angles.\\nStep 2: Measure 2 mm from one end of the block and \\ndraw a line at this level, encircling the block (on all \\nfour sides). (This end of the block will be the incisal \\nFIGURE 13-6.

Although it is \\nconvenient to allow the 2 mm on all carvings, it is \\nessential only for molars.)\\nStep 3: From the 2-mm line, measure the crown length \\nand draw a second line around the block at this level. \\nThis line is the location of the cervical line on the \\nfacial, mesial, distal, and lingual sides of the tooth \\n(Fig. 13-7A).\\nStep 4: From this cervical line, measure one half of the \\nlength of the root and draw a third line around the \\nblock. (The end of the block beyond this line will be \\nreferred to now as the base.)\\nStep 5: On the base of the block, carve, on appropriate \\nsides, F (facial), L (lingual), M (mesial), and D (dis-\\ntal). Be sure to put M and D in the proper relation to \\nF and L so that you will carve a right or a left tooth, \\nwhichever you intend.\\nStep 6: Using a very sharp pencil, draw a shallow line \\nlengthwise on the block in the center of the mesial \\nsurface. Do the same on the distal surface and be \\nsure that these lines are exactly opposite.\\nStep 7: Add 0.5 mm to the faciolingual measurement \\nof the crown. Divide this number by 2. Using this \\nmeasurement, draw a line this distance on either \\nside of the center line on the mesial and distal sides \\nof the block (Fig. 13-7A). These two outer lines \\nshould be parallel to the center line and extend \\nfrom the top of the block to the base. These two \\nlines form a box whose dimension faciolingually \\nis equal to the crown dimension plus 0.5 mm. The \\nextra 0.5 mm is an allowance for safety in carving. \\nDo not make trouble for yourself by allowing more \\nthan this extra 0.5 mm.\\nStep 8: On the mesial side of the block marked M, \\ndraw, within the box, an outline of the mesial side \\nof the tooth as you drew it on the graph paper. Be \\ncareful to place the incisal edge and the labial and \\nlingual crests of curvature accurately. Your carving \\nwill probably be no better than this drawing.\\nStep 9: Draw a similar outline on the distal side of \\nthe block. Be sure that on both sides, the drawings \\nare oriented so that the facial surface of the tooth \\nis toward the side of the block you have marked F \\n(facial). (It is easy to make a mistake here.) These \\ndrawings of the crown may appear slightly fat due \\nto the extra 0.5 mm width allowance confining the \\ncrown size faciolingually.\\nStep 10: Carve away the shaded portions of wax in \\nFigure 13-7B from the facial, lingual, and incisal \\nsides of the block so that it is now shaped like \\nFigure 13-7C. At this time, do not carve around \\nthe outline of the tooth, but rather carve up to the \\nstraight vertical lines that form the box in which \\nthe tooth picture is drawn.\\nStep 11: Check the distance between the two opposite \\ncarved surfaces carefully with your Boley gauge. Be \\nsure they are perfectly flat and smooth. Be sure the \\nthickness of the column of wax between these par-\\nallel surfaces exactly equals the given faciolingual \\ncrown dimension plus 0.5 mm.\\nStep 12: Now carve away the shaded regions seen in \\nFigure 13-7C around and down to the facial and lin-\\ngual outlines of the tooth. Follow the drawing care-\\nfully, making the tooth shape the same all the way \\nthrough the block. Keep the carving surface smooth; \\nif it becomes chopped up, it will be impossible to \\nsmooth it without losing both the shape and the size \\nof the carving.\\nStep 13: With a sharp pencil, very lightly draw center \\nlines on the curved facial and lingual sides of the \\ncarving as in Figure 13-7D. Be sure they are exactly \\nopposite.\\nStep 14: Add 0.5 mm to the mesiodistal crown mea-\\nsurement and draw two lines one half this distance \\non either side of the center line. This makes a box on \\nthe curved surface as wide as the greatest mesiodistal \\ncrown measurement plus 0.5 mm (Fig. 13-7D).\\nStep 15: Redraw a horizontal line the exact crown \\nlength distance from the incisal edge on the facial \\nand lingual sides (since the original line was carved \\naway). Then draw the facial outline of the crown \\nand half of the root on the curved facial side of the \\nblock (Fig. 13-7D).\\nStep 16: On the lingual surface of the block, draw an \\noutline the same shape as the one on the facial sur-\\nface except, of course, that it is a mirror image; the \\ndistal side of the tooth must be toward the same side \\nof the block in each case. Check the crown length \\non the lingual surface too, so the crown will not be \\ntoo long.\\nStep 17: Carve away all the wax outside the drawing \\nbox, removing all the shaded portions as shown in \\nFigure 13-7E. On some first molars, their spreading \\nroots may extend beyond the box lines, and these \\nroots should be carved accordingly. Check your \\nmeasurements again.\\nStep 18: Shape the tooth by carefully carving the mesial \\nand distal contours by removing the shaded portions \\nof Figure 13-7F so that it resembles your tooth spec-\\nimen outline from the facial and lingual sides.\\nStep 19: Now it is time to round off the corners, narrow \\nthe lingual surface, shape the cingulum (it is distal \\nto the center line, and the mesial marginal ridge is'),\n",

This gland secretes hormones which \\nregulate many body functions. There are two pairs \\nof processes or wings (greater and lesser wings) that \\nproject off of the body laterally and superiorly. The \\ngreater wings  are visible internally in Figure 14-4 \\nbut are best viewed externally in Figure 14-2. If you \\nput your thumb on the external surface of the greater \\nwing, you can place your forefinger opposite to your \\nthumb on the inner surface to confirm the location of \\nthe greater wing on the inner surface of the braincase. \\nThese wings extend superiorly from the body, poste-\\nrior to the upper jawbones (maxillae), and medial to \\nthe lower jawbone and cheekbones. The external sur-\\nface of the greater wing (along with part of the tem-\\nporal, frontal, and parietal bones) forms part of each \\ntemporal fossa (outlined in Fig. 14-2) where a muscle \\nof mastication, the temporalis muscle, attaches to the \\nneurocranium. The lesser wings are located superior to \\na fissure in the posterior surface of the eye socket (seen \\ninternally in Fig. 14-4 and externally on the posterior \\nsurface of the eye sockets seen in Fig. 14-7). The fissure \\nbetween the greater wing and the lesser wing is called \\nthe superior orbital fissure, which is the passageway of \\nthe ophthalmic nerve (one part of the trigeminal nerve). \\nLook at this fissure on the inside of the braincase, and \\nthen look at the front of the skull to see this fissure on \\nthe posterior superior surface of the eye socket.\\nThe sphenoid bone also has two important processes \\nthat project inferiorly from the base of the skull adja-\\ncent to the posterior surface of the upper jawbones \\n(maxillae). These are called pterygoid [TER i goid] pro-\\ncesses and are best seen in the lateral view of Figure \\n14-5. (Hint: To remember the name of this process, note \\nthat each has a scalloped border somewhat resembling \\nthe wings of a pterodactyl flying dinosaur.) When each \\npterygoid process is viewed from below (or posteri-\\norly), you can see that it is made up of two thin plates of \\nbone (a lateral pterygoid plate or lamina, and a medial\\npterygoid plate  or lamina) that surround a concav-\\nity about the size of your little finger called the ptery-\\ngoid fossa (Fig. 14-6). This fossa is where one end of \\nanother major muscle of mastication, the medial ptery-\\ngoid muscle, attaches. The lateral surface of the lateral \\npterygoid plate (visible in Fig. 14-5) is where one end \\nof yet another muscle of mastication (the lateral ptery-\\ngoid muscle) attaches. The medial plate has a hook-like \\nprojection just posterior and medial to the third molars \\nand behind the palate, called the pterygoid hamulus\\n(Figs. 14-5 and 14-6). The space just lateral to and \\nposterior to the lateral plate and inferior to the temporal \\nbone is called the infratemporal space (Fig. 14-5), and \\nit is filled with muscles, ligaments, vessels, and nerves, \\nwhich will be described later. Note that all of the terms \\npresented here that contain “ptery” relate to the ptery-\\ngoid process of the sphenoid bone, and the closest you \\ncan come to touching this process on your own head \\nis by placing a clean finger in the mouth and sliding it \\nposterior, superior, and medial to the maxillary third \\nmolars. Confirm this by looking at a skull.\\nTwo pairs of foramina in the sphenoid bone are \\nimportant to dental professionals: the foramen rotun-\\ndum and the foramen ovale. The oval, more posterior \\nforamen ovale  is the passage of the important man-\\ndibular nerve (part of the trigeminal nerve) that passes \\nfrom the brain to the mandibular teeth and jaw, and the \\nchewing muscles. The foramen ovale is best seen inter-\\nnally in Figure 14-4 and externally in Figure 14-6. On \\na skull, if you carefully pass a pipe cleaner through this \\nforamen, you will see that it drops inferiorly through \\nthe infratemporal space (beneath part of the temporal \\nbone) toward the lower jaw (mandible). The foramen \\novale can be easily identified by its proximity to the \\nmuch smaller foramen spinosum  [spy NO sum] that \\nis located just posterior to it. Just posterior to the fora-\\nmen spinosum on the inferior surface is a thorn-shaped \\nbony prominence called the sphenoidal [SFE noid al] \\nspine (or angular spine) (Fig. 14-6). This spine is the \\nsuperior attachment of the sphenomandibular ligament,\\nwhich extends inferiorly from the spine toward the \\nmedial surface of the lower jaw (mandible).\\nThe foramen rotundum  [ro TUN dum] is visible \\nonly internally in Figure 14-4 and is round, anterior, \\nand just slightly medial to the foramen ovale. It is the \\nopening for the passage of another important branch \\nof the trigeminal nerve called the maxillary nerve\\n(another part of the trigeminal nerve) that supplies \\nall maxillary teeth. If you are able to carefully pass a \\npipe cleaner from the brain case through this foramen, \\nit will be somewhat hidden in a space between the \\npterygoid process and upper jawbone (maxilla). This \\nspace between the pterygoid process and the posterior \\nwall of the maxilla (which is covered in part by verti-\\ncal projections of the palatine bones) is known as the \\npterygopalatine [TER i go PAL eh tine] space labeled \\nin Figure 14-5. The maxillary nerve that exits the skull \\nthrough the foramen rotundum proceeds through this \\npterygopalatine space as it gives off branches to the \\nupper jaw (maxillae) and teeth.\\nAt this time, look inside the brain case to review the \\nlocation for the openings of the three branches of the \\ntrigeminal nerve on each half of the skull (Fig. 14-4). \\nThe trigeminal nerve begins within the braincase as'),\n",

The \\nmost anterior opening is the superior orbital fissure \\nfor the ophthalmic branch. Posterior to it is the fora-\\nmen rotundum for the maxillary branch, and the more \\nposterior (and slightly lateral) foramen ovale is for the \\nmandibular branch. (Recall that the much smaller fora-\\nmen spinosum is just posterior to the foramen ovale.)\\nC. LARGE BONES OF THE FACE AND \\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT (TMJ)\\nThe form of 14 facial bones gives us our appearance. \\nThey function in both respiration and digestion. The \\nfacial bones are located inferior to the forehead and \\nmake up most of the anterior part of the skull. Five large \\nbones of the face are the mandible, two maxillae, and \\ntwo zygomatic (cheek) bones. The smaller bones of the \\nface are the vomer, two palatine, two nasal, two lacri-\\nmal bones, and two inferior nasal conchae [KONG kee] \\n(also called turbinates). The mandible and maxillae are \\nmost important when considering the foundation for \\nteeth and tooth function, so they will be discussed in \\nmost detail. Although the temporal bones are not con-\\nsidered facial bones, they are being discussed here due \\nto their importance in our understanding of the TMJ.\\n1. MAXILLAE\\nOne maxilla is shaded red in Figure 14-7. Each maxilla\\n[mak SILL a] (right or left) consists of one large, hol-\\nlow, central mass called the body, and four projecting \\nprocesses or extensions of bone. The plural of maxilla is \\nmaxillae [mack SILL ee]. The two maxillae contain all \\nof the maxillary teeth.\\na. Body of the Maxilla (Structures \\nSeen in Fig. 14-7)\\nThe body of the maxilla is shaped like a four-sided, hol-\\nlow pyramid with the base oriented vertically next to \\nthe nasal cavity and the apex or peak extending later-\\nally into part of the cheekbone (or zygomatic bone). \\nThe superior portion of the maxilla forms the floor \\nof the orbit of the eye where an infraorbital fissure is \\nlocated. This fissure disappears anteriorly to become \\nthe infraorbital canal  (hidden within the bone in \\nFig. 14-7). Important branches of the fifth CN and ves-\\nsels enter this fissure and canal and give off branches \\nwithin the canal, which supply some of the maxillary \\nteeth and surrounding tissue. The infraorbital nerves and \\nvessels exit the infraorbital canal on to the face through \\nthe infraorbital foramen. This foramen is on the ante-\\nrior surface of the body of the maxilla, inferior to the \\neye orbit and superior to the canine fossa, which is a \\nshallow depression superior and lateral to the canine.\\nb. Maxillary Sinus or Antrum\\nSinuses are hollow spaces within bones and are found \\nwithin the sphenoid, frontal, and ethmoid bones, as \\nwell as within each maxilla. The maxillary sinus ,\\nlocated within the body of each maxilla, functions to \\n(a) lighten the skull, (b) give resonance to the voice, \\n(c) warm the air we breathe, and (d) moisten the nasal \\ncavity. (The average size of each maxillary sinus in an \\nadult is about 25 mm from side to side, 30 mm from \\nfront to back, and 30 mm high, with an average capacity \\nof 15 mL (range: 9.5 to 20 mL)\\n1 or about 1 tablespoon.)\\nRefer to Figure 14-8  while reading about the max-\\nillary sinus. This large, four-sided, pyramid-shaped \\ncavity is located within the body of each maxilla. It is \\nimportant to dental health professionals because of the \\nclose relationship it has to the teeth. The sinus cavity \\nfloor extends inferiorly onto the superior portion of the \\nmaxillary alveolar process where projections of the api-\\nces of the molar roots, and sometimes premolar roots, \\nmay be found. This intimate relationship between the \\nteeth and maxillary sinus space can be appreciated in \\nFigure 14-9A and B. Only very thin bone lies between \\nthe floor of the sinus and the apices of the roots of the \\nmaxillary molars. In rare cases, no bone separates the \\nroot apices from the sinus, but there is always soft tis-\\nsue between the root and the space of the cavity, made \\nup of the periodontal ligament on the tooth root and the \\nmucous membrane lining the sinus cavity. Sometimes \\nwhen a dentist extracts a molar and the root breaks off, \\nhe or she is unjustly accused of pushing the root into \\nthe sinus. It may have been located in the maxillary \\nsinus prior to the extraction. The other three walls of \\nthe pyramid-shaped sinus are toward the orbit of the \\neye, toward the face, and posteriorly and laterally, next \\nto the infratemporal space.\\nThe nerves to the maxillary molars ( posterior supe-\\nrior alveolar [PSA] nerves ) enter the maxilla and sinus \\nlining through very small foramina called the alveolar\\n[al VEE o lar] canals located posterior and superior to \\nthe maxillary third molars (Fig. 14-8). These nerves \\npass just beneath the membrane lining of the sinus or \\nthrough bony canals within the walls of the sinus. An \\ninfection in either the sinus or these teeth can spread \\nto the other. Pain caused by a maxillary sinus infection \\ncan be mistaken for pain originating in any one or all \\nof the molars or premolars on that side. Unfortunately, \\nhealthy teeth are sometimes extracted in a futile attempt \\nto alleviate pain that was caused by a chronic maxillary \\nsinus infection.'),\n",

The lining secretes mucous that \\nmoves spirally and upward (against gravity) across the \\nmembrane toward the opening of the sinus, which is \\nlocated on the anterosuperior wall (Fig. 14-8), where \\nsecretions can drains into the nasal cavity. If humans \\nwalked on all fours with the head forward like many \\nanimals, this opening for drainage would be on the floor \\nof the sinus, not near the roof, and humans would have \\nfewer sinus problems. Persons with a congested maxil-\\nlary sinus may get pain relief by placing their head with \\nthe face downward for several minutes to permit more \\nrapid drainage of the maxillary sinuses.\\nc. Bony Processes of Each Maxilla\\nThere are four processes extending out from the body \\nof the maxillae. The first three described below are best \\nviewed in Figure 14-7.\\n(1) Frontal (or Nasofrontal) Process\\nThe frontal (or nasofrontal) process derives its name \\nfrom the fact that its medial edge joins with the nasal \\nbone, extending superiorly to also articulate with the \\nfrontal bone. The medial surface forms part of the lat-\\neral wall of the nasal cavity and half of the opening of \\nthe nasal cavity (called the piriform aperture because \\nof its pear shape).\\n(2) Zygomatic Process\\nThe bulky zygomatic process forms part of the anterior \\nor facial surface of each maxilla. It extends laterally to \\njoin with the maxillary process of the zygomatic bone.\\n(3) Alveolar Process\\nThe horseshoe-shaped alveolar [al VEE o lar]  processes\\nof the right and left maxillae (also found on the man-\\ndible, described later) extend from the body of the \\nmaxillae to surround the roots of all maxillary teeth. \\nThe extension of these process from the body of each \\nmaxilla is best appreciated by viewing the maxillary \\nfrom below since when viewed laterally, the alveo-\\nlar process appears to be continuous with the body of \\nthe maxilla (seen shaded on the right maxilla and the \\nentire lower jaw or mandible in Fig. 14-7 and identi-\\nfied in cross section in Fig. 14-10). Within each alveo-\\nlar process, the roots of each tooth are embedded in an \\nindividual alveoli (or tooth sockets) that are visible in \\nthe mouth after a recent tooth extraction. The shape of \\neach alveolus or thin bony socket naturally corresponds \\nclosely with the shape of the roots of the tooth it sur-\\nrounds. Alveolar eminences are raised ridges of bone \\nexternally overlying prominent tooth root convexities. \\nThe alveolar eminence over the canine tooth on each \\nside is called the canine eminence (Fig. 14-7). Medial \\nto the canine eminence is a shallow fossa over the root \\nof the maxillary lateral incisor called the incisive [in SI \\nsiv] fossa. Lateral and superior to the canine eminence \\nis a fossa over the roots of maxillary premolars named \\nthe canine fossa.\\nThe alveolar process is made up of several bony lay-\\ners (seen in cross section of the mandible in Fig. 14-10). \\nThe mandibular bone is made up of the thickened inner \\n(lingual) and outer (facial) dense cortical plate with less \\ndense trabecular [trah BEK u lar] bone sandwiched in \\nbetween. Trabecular bone is composed of many plate-\\nlike bone partitions that separate the irregularly shaped \\nmarrow spaces located within this bone. Synonyms for \\ntrabecular bone include cancellous or spongy bone. \\nSmall nerve branches and vessels actually pass through \\nthis spongy bone to enter all teeth through their apical \\nforamen. A thin, compact bony layer lines the wall of \\neach tooth socket (or alveolus) and shows up on radio-\\ngraphs as a white line called the lamina dura . Other \\nterms used to describe this bony layer include alveolar \\nbony socket, alveolar bone, true alveolar bone, alveolar \\nbone proper, and cribriform plate of the alveolar pro-\\ncess. The only space between the outer layer of tooth \\nroot (which is covered with cementum) and this alveo-\\nlar bone is occupied by a periodontal ligament that sus-\\npends each tooth within its alveolus by attaching the \\ncircumference of each tooth root to the surrounding \\nalveolar bony socket. The periodontal ligament is very \\nthin [less than a third of a millimeter].\\n(4) Palatine Process of the Maxilla\\nThe right and left palatine [Pal a tine] processes\\n(Fig. 14-11) join to form the anterior three quarters of \\nthe bony roof of the mouth called the hard palate. The \\npalatine bones, discussed later in this chapter, form the \\nposterior one quarter of the hard palate. The palatine \\nprocess of each maxilla is a thin, bony shelf that projects \\nhorizontally to join the process from the opposite side. \\nThe entire hard palate separates the nasal passageways \\nfrom the oral cavity.

Ramus of the Mandible: Lateral Surfaces\\nRefer to Figure 14-12 while reading about this surface. \\nThere are two processes on the superior end of each \\nramus. The coronoid [KOR o noyd] process is the more \\npointed, anterior process on the upper border. The sec-\\nond more rounded and posterior process of the ramus \\nis the condyloid [KON di loyd] process (also called the \\nmandibular condyle ). This process is composed of a \\nbulky condyle head and a narrow neck that attaches the \\nhead to the ramus. The sigmoid notch (also called the \\nmandibular or semilunar notch) is located between \\nthe coronoid process and the condyloid process. One \\npart of an important muscle of mastication, the lateral \\npterygoid, attaches to the front of the neck of the condy-\\nloid process in a depression called the pterygoid fovea \\n(Fig. 14-14). The head of the mandibular condyle fits \\ninto and functions beneath the articular (glenoid) fossa \\nof the temporal bone (which is discussed in more detail \\nlater in this chapter).\\nc. Internal or Medial Surface of Mandible\\nRefer to Figure 14-14 while reading about this surface \\nof the mandible. The mandibular foramen is a promi-\\nnent opening located on the medial surface of the \\nramus inferior to the sigmoid notch near the middle \\nof the ramus anterioposteriorly. It is the entrance into \\nthe mandibular canal where the inferior alveolar  ves-\\nsels and nerves pass from the infratemporal space into \\nthe mandible. The mandibular lingula [LING gu lah] \\nis a tongue-shaped projection of bone just anterior and \\nslightly superior to the mandibular foramen. This is \\nwhere the inferior end of the sphenomandibular ligament \\nattaches to the mandible. The superior end attaches to \\nthe angular (sphenoidal) spine on the sphenoid bone. \\nThe mylohyoid groove  is a small groove running \\n inferior and anterior from the mandibular foramen. \\nThe mylohyoid nerve rests in this groove.\\nThe temporal crest is a ridge of bone extending from \\nthe tip of the coronoid process onto the medial surface \\nof the ramus and terminating near the third molar. The \\ntendon from the fibers of the wide, flat, fan-shaped tem-\\nporalis muscle attaches here. The inferior one fourth of \\nthe temporal crest is called the internal oblique line. It \\nis most important as a radiographic, rather than an ana-\\ntomic, landmark. It appears on radiographs as a short, \\ncurved line somewhat inferior to the image of the exter-\\nnal oblique line.\\nThe retromolar fossa is a roughened shallow fossa \\ndistal to the last molar and bounded medially by the \\nlowest portion of the temporal crest and laterally by the \\nexternal oblique ridge. The retromolar triangle  is in \\nthe lowest most anterior, and only horizontal, portion \\nof the retromolar fossa.

TEMPORAL BONES: FORMING \\nTHE SUPERIOR PART OF THE \\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT\\nThe temporal bones are a pair of complex bones that \\nform part of the sides and base of the neurocranium \\n(brain case) (best seen laterally in Fig. 14-15 where one \\nis shaded blue). Laterally , the temporal fossa (outlined \\nin Fig. 14-15) is a large, very shallow depression in the \\ntemple region of the face formed primarily by the lateral \\npart of the temporal bone (also called the squamous \\npart because it is shaped like a large fish scale), and also \\nby the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and parts of \\nthe parietal and frontal bones that were discussed ear-\\nlier. The temporal fossa is where the superior end of \\nthe major muscle of mastication (the temporalis muscle) \\nattaches. Squamosal [skwa MO sal] sutures join the \\ntemporal bones to the parietal bones.\\nThe paired temporal bones are especially important \\nto dental professionals since each has a mandibular \\nfossa (one is labeled on the right side of Fig. 14-16 ) \\nlocated on the inferior aspect of the temporal bones. \\nIt is within these fossae that the condyloid processes \\nof the mandible articulate with the temporal bones on \\nthe base of the neurocranium. This jaw joint (actually \\na joint on each side) is called the temporomandibular \\njoint (commonly abbreviated TMJ) where the temporal \\nbone and mandible articulate. Each mandibular fossa \\ncan be divided into two parts by the petrotympanic \\nfissure (Fig. 14-16). The anterior two thirds of each \\nmandibular fossa (that portion anterior to the petro-\\ntympanic fissure) is the important articular fossa (or \\nglenoid fossa). Each articular fossa has a ridge of bone \\nforming its anterior border, which is called the articu-\\nlar eminence.\\nFIGURE 14-15.

The \\n zygomatic [zy go MAT ik] process (Fig. 14-15) is \\nthe finger of bone extending anterior and lateral to \\nthe mandibular fossa of the TMJ. It joins with the tem-\\nporal process of the zygomatic bone (and the zygomatic \\nprocess of the maxillae) to form an arch called the \\nzygomatic arch. This arch shape of bones, seen from \\nbeneath in Figure 14-16, is the attachment of one end of \\nthe large muscle of mastication ( masseter muscle). The \\nprominent mastoid process  or portion (Fig. 14-15), \\nseen inferiorly and posteriorly to the mandibular fossa, \\nis the attachment for one end of a major neck muscle, \\nthe sternocleidomastoid muscle. You can feel the bump \\nof the mastoid process behind your ear lobe. Also on \\nthe inferior surface of the temporal bones but more \\nmedial is the styloid process (Fig. 14-15), shaped like a \\nsmall skinny pencil (or stylus).

This petrous portion of the tem-\\nporal bone contains the auditory canal with the minute \\nbones of hearing known as the malleus, incus, and sta-\\npes. The carotid canal is the passageway of the inter-\\nnal carotid artery  into the brain case, and the jugular \\nforamen (between the temporal and occipital bones) is \\nwhere the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) passes out of \\nthe brain case (seen externally in Fig. 14-16 and inter-\\nnally in Fig. 14-17).\\nFIGURE 14-16.

The hyoid bone is not connected to the bones \\nof the skull except via soft tissue. A group of muscles \\nthat extend from the hyoid bone superiorly to attach \\nto the mandible are called suprahyoid muscles  (such as \\nthe geniohyoid muscles that also attach to the genial \\ntubercles), and another group that extend inferiorly \\nfrom the hyoid bone to attach to the sternum (breast-\\nbone) or clavicle (collar bone) are called infrahyoid \\nmuscles.\\nFIGURE 14-17.

Learning Exercise, cont.\\nTHE TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT (TMJ)SECTION II\\nAn introduction to the TMJ was presented in Chapter 9 on \\nOcclusion, but this chapter goes into more detail regarding \\nthe anatomy of this joint. A joint, or articulation, is a con-\\nnection between two separate bones of the skeleton. The \\nTMJ is the articulation between the two condyles of the \\nmandible and the two temporal bones. For that reason, \\nsome authors state that we have two TMJs. This articula-\\ntion may also correctly be termed the craniomandibular \\narticulation since it is the articulation between the mov-\\nable mandible and the stationary cranium or skull.\\n3 It is a \\nbilateral articulation since the right and left sides work as \\na unit. It is the only visible free-moving articulation in the \\nhead; all others are sutures and are immovable.\\n4\\nThe coordinated movements of the right and left \\njoints are complex and usually controlled by reflexes. \\nWithin some limit or range, the great adaptability of \\nthe joints permits the freedom of movement of the \\nmandible required during speech and mastication \\n(chewing). One can learn, however, to move the man-\\ndible voluntarily into specific, well-defined positions or \\npathways.\\n5–9 Both the maxillae and mandible support \\nteeth whose shape and position greatly influence man-\\ndibular movements. 3 Proper functioning of the TMJs \\nhas a profound effect on the occlusal contacts of teeth, \\nwhich involve nearly all phases of dentistry.\\nA. ANATOMY OF THE \\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT\\nThere are three articulating parts to each TMJ: the \\nmandibular condyle, the articular fossa of the tempo-\\nral bone (with its adjacent eminence), and the articular \\ndisc interposed between the bony parts (Figs. 14-19 and\\n14-20). These parts are enclosed by a fibrous connec-\\ntive tissue capsule.\\n1,4,7\\n1. MANDIBULAR CONDYLE\\nEach mandibular condyle [KON dile] is about the size \\nand shape of a large date pit with the greater dimension \\nmediolaterally than anterioposteriorly, evident when \\ncomparing the width of the condyle mediolaterally in \\nFigure 14-20 to the narrower width anterioposteriorly \\nseen from the side in Figure 14-19. From the poste-\\nrior (or anterior) aspect, it is wide mediolaterally with \\nOBJECTIVES\\nThe objectives for this section are to prepare the \\nreader to perform the following:\\n• Describe and locate (on a skull) the articulating \\nparts of the TMJ.\\n• Describe the location and functions of the articular \\ndisc.\\n• Palpate the lateral and posterior surfaces of the \\ncondyle of the mandible during movement of the \\njaws.\\n• On a skull, describe and locate the attachments of \\nthe ligaments of the TMJ.'),\n",

ARTICULAR FOSSA (NONFUNCTIONING \\nPORTION) AND ARTICULAR EMINENCE \\n(FUNCTIONING PORTION)\\nStudy the right side of Figure 14-20 where half of the \\nmandible has been removed, exposing the maxillary \\nteeth and articular fossa and eminence of the tempo-\\nral bone. The articular (glenoid) fossa is the portion of \\nthe mandibular fossa that is anterior to the petrotym-\\npanic fissure. It is considered to be a nonfunctioning \\nportion of the joint because, when the teeth are in tight \\nocclusion, there is no tight contact from the head of \\nthe condyle through the disc to the concave part of the \\narticular fossa.\\nThe articular eminence or transverse bony ridge is \\nlocated just anterior and inferior to the articular fossa \\n(Fig. 14-19). As stated previously, its posterior infe-\\nrior surface is padded or lined with a thickened layer \\nof fibrous connective tissue, more than the rest of the \\narticular fossa (Fig. 14-21), indicating that this is the \\nfunctional portion of the joint that take the force when \\nwe are chewing food with the mandible in a slightly \\nprotruded and/or lateral position. This is where the \\nanterior superior portion of the mandibular condyle \\nrubs against it, but only indirectly since the articular \\ndisc is normally interposed between the two function-\\ning bony elements.\\n3. ARTICULAR DISC\\nExamine a skull with the posterior teeth fitting together \\n(in tight occlusion) and study how the mandibular \\ncondyle fits loosely into the articular fossa. The disc is \\nnot present in a prepared dry skull because the disc is \\nnot bone. There should be a visible space between the \\nmandibular condyle and the articular fossa that, in life, \\nwas occupied by the disc.\\nThe articular disc (Figs. 14-21 and 14-22) is a tough \\noval pad of dense fibrous connective tissue acting as \\na shock absorber between the mandibular condyle and \\nthe articular fossa and articular eminence. The disc sur-\\nfaces are very smooth. Each disc is thinner in the center \\nthan around the edges. This shape provides one natural \\nwedge anterior to the condyle head and a second wedge \\nposterior to the condyle. Rarely, it may become per-\\nforated. The center of the disc has no blood supply\\n10; \\nhowever, it is richly supplied elsewhere. The upper sur-\\nface of the disc is concave anteriorly to conform to the \\nconvex articular eminence, and it is convex posteriorly, \\nconforming to the concave shape of the articular fossa \\nthat it loosely rests against. The lower surface of the disc \\nis concave anterior to posterior, thus adapting to the \\nupper surface of the convex mandibular condyle.\\nThe articular disc has many functions.\\n11,12 It divides \\nthe space between the head of the condyle and the \\narticulating fossa into upper and lower spaces (synovial \\ncavities seen in Fig. 14-22), which permits complex \\nfunctional movements of the mandible.\\n12 The anterior \\nand posterior portions of the disc contain specialized \\nnerve fibers called proprioceptive [PRO pri o SEP tiv] \\nfibers, which help to unconsciously determine the \\nposition of the mandible, and therefore help regulate \\nmovements of the condyle. It stabilizes the condyle by \\nFIGURE 14-22. Temporomandibular joint, \\nsagittal section: The anterior surface of the skull \\n(face) is to the left.

The cushioning and lubrica-\\ntion reduce physical wear and strain on joint surfaces.\\nAs the mandible moves forward, the discs move for-\\nward with the mandible due, in part, to the thickened \\nborders of each disc, which conforms to the shape of the \\ncondyles, and because the muscles that pull the mandi-\\nble forward (lateral pterygoids) are attached to the neck \\nof each condyles (in the pterygoid fovea) as well as to \\nthe discs. When the thicker peripheral portions of the \\ndiscs become flattened or the center of the disc thick-\\nens, the disc fails to move synchronously with the con-\\ndyle, resulting in a popping or grating noise ( crepitus), \\nwhich is quite an annoying yet a fairly common occur-\\nrence.

The lower border is \\nattached around the neck of the condyloid process, \\nthus enclosing the condyle and completing the tube.\\nThe internal surface of the fibrous capsule is lined \\nwith a synovial membrane  that surrounds the bones \\nand their articulating surfaces. This thin membrane \\nsecretes a fluid, synovial fluid , which lubricates the \\njoint. This fluid is three times more slippery than ice. \\nThe synovial fluid both lubricates and nourishes the \\nfibrous covering of the articulating surfaces and center \\nof the disc that lack a blood supply . In a normal joint \\nspace, there is only a small amount of fluid (one or \\ntwo drops).\\nThe articular disc is not attached to the skull, \\nbut anteriorly it is attached to the fibrous capsule. \\nPosteriorly , the disc and the capsule are connected by \\na thick pad of loose elastic vascular connective tis-\\nsue called the bilaminar zone  (Fig. 14-21). Laterally \\nand medially , each disc is tightly attached to the lat-\\neral and medial sides of the mandibular condyle but \\nnot to the capsule. Therefore, the disc can follow the \\nmovement of the condyle when the muscles ( lateral \\npterygoid muscles  attached to the neck of the condyle \\nand the discs) move the mandible and discs forward. \\nThis design of attachments gives each disc freedom to \\nmove anteriorly but limits it from excessive forward \\nmovement that could result in its displacement ante-\\nrior to the head of the condyle.\\n14 The anterior part of \\nthis fibrous capsule prevents excessive movement \\nof the condyle of the mandible on wide openings as it \\nbecomes taut.\\n2. LATERAL LIGAMENT (FORMERLY \\nTMJ LIGAMENT)\\nThe outer layer of the fibrous capsule is a thicker layer \\nof fibrous tissue that is reinforced by accessory liga-\\nments, which strengthen it. The lateral ligament of this \\njoint is the strong reinforcement of the anterior lateral \\nwall of the capsule (Fig. 14-23). It attaches to the zygo-\\nmatic arch and is directed obliquely down and poste-\\nrior to the lateral and posterior neck of the condyle. \\nThis ligament keeps the condyle close to the fossa and \\nhelps to prevent lateral and posterior displacement \\nof the mandible. It has no counterpart medially, and \\nseemingly none is needed since the right and left tem-\\nporomandibular articulations work together as a unit. \\nThe lateral ligament on the opposite side, by failing to \\nstretch, prevents excess medial displacement on the \\nside moving medially.\\n3. STYLOMANDIBULAR LIGAMENT\\nThe stylomandibular [STY lo man DIB yoo lar] liga-\\nment is posterior to the joint but also gives support to \\nthe mandible (Fig. 14-24). It is relaxed when the mouth \\nis closed but becomes tense on extreme protrusion of \\nthe mandible.\\n13 It is attached above to the styloid pro-\\ncess of the temporal bone and below to the posterior \\nborder and angle of the mandible.\\n4. SPHENOMANDIBULAR LIGAMENT\\nThe sphenomandibular [SFE no man DIB yoo lar] \\n ligament is medial to the joint (Fig. 14-24). It gives \\nsome support to the mandible and may help limit maxi-\\nmum opening of the jaw. It is attached superiorly to the \\nFIGURE 14-24.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE \\nTEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT\\nIn infants, the articular fossa, the articular eminence, \\nand the condyle are rather flat. This flatness allows for \\na wide range of sliding motions in the TMJ. Also, this \\njoint is at about the same level as the occlusal plane \\nat birth with relatively no ramus height ( Fig. 14-25 ). \\nDuring growth, the articular fossa deepens, the articu-\\nlar eminence becomes prominent, the condyle becomes \\nrounded, and the shape of the disc changes to conform \\nto the change in shape of the fossa and condyle. There \\nis also a lengthening of the ramus. The condyle con-\\ntains cartilage beneath its surface, and the condyloid \\nprocess and ramus lengthen until a person is 20 to \\n25 years old. As a result of growth in the condyle area, \\nthe body of the mandible is lowered from the skull, and \\nthe occlusal plane is located about 1 in. below the level \\nof the condyles in an adult.\\nD. ADVANCED TOPICS: DIMENSIONS \\nRELATED TO THE TMJ\\nThe average width of the condyle and its depth beneath \\nthe skin is illustrated in Figure 14-26. The condyle is \\na large solid structure, about 10 mm thick anteropos-\\nteriorly and 20.4 mm wide mediolaterally. Although \\nthe average depth of the outer surface of the condyle is \\n15 mm beneath the skin, it is readily palpated, and its \\nmovements are visible (seemingly just beneath the skin) \\nwhen eating. Research by Drs. Woelfel and Igarashi on \\n25 men found the average depth of the outer surface of \\nthe mandibular condyle on each side to be 15.0 mm; \\nthe range was 10.3 to 21.4 mm beneath skin.\\nThe size of the mandibular fossa averages about 23 mm \\nmediolaterally and extends 15 mm  posteriorly from the \\nFIGURE 14-25.

(To \\nobtain these measurements, metal markers were placed \\non the skin and some teeth on 25 men prior to taking \\nsubmental vertex cephalometric radiographs for analy-\\nsis, tracing, and measuring. The location of the center \\nof rotational opening of the mandible [the hinge axis] \\nwas found to pass through or near the center of the \\nheads of the condyles. The functional axes were deter-\\nmined from pantographic recordings. Resultant articu-\\nlar settings were found to be wider than the outer poles \\nof the condyles. This means that lateral and protrusive \\nexcursions are controlled by ligaments and muscles, \\nrather than by bone, as previously reported. This \\nresearch was conducted by Drs.

Skeletal or voluntary muscles are made up \\nof specialized cells that contract. Skeletal muscles are \\nvery active metabolically and therefore require a rich \\nblood supply.\\n15 There are two other kinds of muscles, \\ncardiac and smooth (involuntary) muscles, which we \\nare unable to control or direct.\\nIndividual muscle cells are small, elongated con-\\ntractile fibers, each enclosed in a delicate envelope of \\nloose connective tissue. Many individual parallel mus-\\ncle fibers make up a bundle, and various numbers of \\nbundles comprise a muscle. The longest muscle fibers \\nare 300 mm (11.4 in.) long. Each contractile bundle \\nof cells can contract about 57% of its fully stretched \\nlength.\\n16 The all-or-none law states that any single \\nmuscle fiber always contracts to its fullest extent. 11\\nWhen a weak effort or contraction is required of the \\nwhole muscle, then only a few fibers contract (each to \\nthe fullest extent). Many fibers contracting produce \\ngreater power as needed. No single muscle acts alone \\nto produce a movement or to maintain posture. Many \\nmuscles must work in perfect coordination to produce \\na steady, well-directed motion of a body part.\\nWhen a muscle becomes shorter as it moves a struc-\\nture, the movement is called an isotonic contraction. \\nWhen a muscle maintains its length as it contracts to \\nstabilize a part, this movement is called isometric con-\\ntraction. As you close your jaw until all teeth contact, \\nthe closing muscles work isotonically because they \\nbecome shorter as the mandible moves superiorly. If \\nyou maintain contact of all of your teeth but squeeze \\nthem together hard, these same muscles are contract-\\ning isometrically because they cannot shorten any more \\nonce your teeth are together.\\nA few or more individual muscles fibers of all of our \\nvoluntary muscles are continually or alternately con-\\ntracting during consciousness. This minimal amount of \\ncontraction needed to maintain posture is called mus-\\ncle tone or tonus, and the muscles involved are named \\n“antigravity” muscles. As you read this, the muscles \\nof mastication are probably in a state of minimal tonic \\ncontraction or balance with each other, with the neck \\nmuscles, and with gravity , enabling a comfortable, rest-\\nful position for your mandible with the teeth apart. This \\nnormal resting jaw position varies slightly according to \\nwhether you are sitting, lying on your back, or standing \\nup, and depending on how tense or stressed you are. \\nWhen you fall asleep at your desk, antigravity muscles \\nrelax and, as you may have seen on others, the mouth \\ndrops open.'),\n",

MUSCLES INVOLVED \\nIN MASTICATION (CHEWING)\\nMuscles of mastication or chewing move the  mandible. \\nThey include four pairs of muscles (right and left): \\nmasseter, temporalis, medial pterygoid, and lateral ptery-\\ngoid muscles. These muscles have the major control over \\nthe movements of the mandible. Each of these muscles has \\none end identified as its origin and the other end identi-\\nfied as its insertion. The origin end of each of the muscles \\nof mastication is the source, beginning, or fixed proximal \\nattachment located, in this case, on the bones of the neu-\\nrocranium that are relatively immovable. The insertion \\nend is the attachment on the movable bone that for each \\nof these muscles is attached to, and moves, the mandible.\\nThere are five different ways in which the mandible \\nmoves. We can elevate it (closing the mouth), depress it \\n(opening the mouth), retrude (retracting or pulling back \\nthe mandible), protrude it (protracting or moving the \\nmandible anteriorly), and move it into lateral excursions \\n(moving the mandible sideways, as when chewing).\\n1. MASSETER MUSCLE\\nThe masseter [ma SEE ter] muscle ( Fig. 14-27 ) is \\nthe most superficial, bulky, and powerful of the \\nmuscles of mastication. It is four sided in shape. Its aver-\\nage volume is over twice that of the medial  pterygoid \\nmuscle (on 25 males is 30.4 ± 4.1 cm\\n3, which is \\n2.6 times larger than the medial pterygoid muscle at \\n11.5 ± 2.1 cm\\n3).17\\nOrigin: The masseter arises from the inferior and \\nmedial surfaces of the zygomatic arch that is made up of \\nthe zygomatic bone, the zygomatic process of the max-\\nillae, and the temporal process of zygomatic bone (seen \\nin Fig. 14-28). From here, it extends inferiorly and pos-\\nteriorly toward its insertion.\\nInsertion: The masseter inserts on the inferior \\n lateral surface of the ramus and angle of the mandible  \\n(Fig. 14-28).\\nAction: It elevates the mandible (closes the mouth) \\nand applies great power in crushing food.\\n6,8,9\\nFIGURE 14-27.

The muscle will produce a notice-\\nable bulge beneath your finger each time. The part \\nfelt just inferior to the cheekbone (anterior to the \\near lobe) is near the origin, and the bulge felt over \\nthe angle of the mandible is near the insertion.'),\n",

LATERAL PTERYGOID MUSCLE\\nThe lateral pterygoid muscle , unlike the other three \\npairs of muscles where most fibers are oriented primar-\\nily vertically, has its fibers aligned mostly horizontally \\n(Fig. 14-32). The lateral pterygoid muscle is a short, \\nthick, somewhat conical muscle located deep in the \\ninfratemporal fossa (inferior to the temporal bone and \\nposterior to the maxillae) and is the prime mover of the \\nmandible except for closing the jaw.\\nOrigin: The lateral pterygoid muscle arises from two \\nheads, both located on the sphenoid bone. The smaller \\nsuperior head is attached to the infratemporal surface of \\nthe greater wing of the sphenoid bone; the larger inferior \\nhead is attached to the adjacent lateral surface of the lat-\\neral pterygoid plate  on the sphenoid bone ( Figs. 14-32 \\nand 14-34). Fibers pass posteriorly and laterally in a hor-\\nizontal direction toward their insertion. When viewed \\nfrom below , the direction of these fibers from their inser-\\ntion on the anterior surfaces of the mandibular condyles \\nis represented by the arrow in Figure 14-33.\\nInsertion: The lateral pterygoid muscle inserts on \\nthe depression on the front of the neck of the condyloid \\nprocess called the pterygoid fovea (Fig. 14-30) and into \\nthe anterior margin of the articular disc. Minor forward \\ncontractions of the upper head pulling the disc forward \\nwork in concert with the stretching of the elastic band of \\ntissues behind the disc (retrodiscal tissues) and  permit \\nthe disc to accompany the mandible as it moves for-\\nward, preventing posterior displacement of the disc.\\n14\\nActions: When both lateral pterygoids contract \\nsimultaneously, the action is\\nto • protrude the mandible. No other muscle or groups \\nof muscles are capable of doing this but can only \\nassist in this action as stabilizers or by controlling the \\ndegree of jaw opening during the protrusion.\\n5,6,8,9,18\\nto • depress the mandible. The lateral pterygoids do \\nthis by pulling the articular discs and the condyles \\nforward and down onto the articular eminences, \\nwhich moves the mandible inferiorly and helps rotate \\nit, thereby opening the mouth (illustrated by arrows \\nin Figure 14-28 that indicate the incline of the articu-\\nlar eminence and the same downward direction that \\ncondyles and the mandible take when pulled forward \\nunder the bump of the eminence). The lateral ptery-\\ngoids are assisted somewhat in this task by groups \\nof muscles in the neck attached from the mandible \\nto the hyoid bone (called the suprahyoid muscles) \\nand from the hyoid bone to the clavicle and sternum \\ncalled the infrahyoid muscles.\\nWhen only one lateral pterygoid contracts, it pulls \\nthe condyle on that side toward the midline (medially) \\nFIGURE 14-34. Part of human skull, lateral \\nview, has the lateral wall of the maxilla \\nremoved to expose the maxillary sinus. \\nPosterior to the maxilla, note the location of \\nthe origin of the two heads of the lateral \\npterygoid muscle: the lateral surface of the \\nlateral pterygoid plate (shaded yellow) just \\nposterior to the maxilla and the roof of the \\ninfratemporal space on the base of the cra-\\nnium.

For example, con-\\ntraction of the right lateral pterygoid muscle draws the \\nright condyle medially (to the left) and forward, causing \\nthe mandible to move toward the left side (into left lat-\\neral excursion). Conversely, the contraction of the left\\nlateral pterygoid muscle causes the mandible to move \\nto the right side ( right lateral excursion ).\\n8 No other \\nmuscle is capable of moving the mandible sideways, \\nalthough synergistic (in harmony with) unilateral con-\\ntraction of the posterior fibers of the temporalis muscle \\noccurs on the side toward which the jaw moves.\\n8\\nB. OTHER MUSCLES AFFECTING \\nMANDIBULAR MOVEMENT\\nOther muscles affecting mandibular movement include \\nthe suprahyoid and infrahyoid group of muscles. The \\nsuprahyoid [SOO prah HI oid] muscle group extends \\nsuperiorly from the hyoid bone to the mandible, \\nwhereas the infrahyoid muscle group extends inferiorly \\nfrom the hyoid bone to the clavicle (collarbone) \\nand sternum (breastbone) and adjacent structures \\n(Fig. 14-35). The inferior hyoid muscles must stabilize \\nthe hyoid bone and keep it from rising, so when the \\nsuprahyoid muscles contract, they can move the man-\\ndible and not just move the hyoid bone. These muscle \\ngroups act together with both lateral pterygoid muscles \\nto help depress the mandible (open the mouth) and act \\nwith the posterior (horizontal) fibers of the temporalis \\nmuscles to retrude (pull back) the mandible.\\nThe suprahyoid muscles include the stylohyoid [STY \\nlo HI oid] muscles (which arise on the styloid process), \\ndigastric [di GAS trik] (the anterior belly of the digas-\\ntric attaches in the digastric fossa near the genial spines \\nor tubercles), mylohyoid (arising from the mylohyoid \\nridges on each half of the medial surface of the mandi-\\nble and found in the tissue that forms the floor of the \\nmouth), and geniohyoid [JEE ni o HI oid] (arising from \\nthe genial tubercles). The infrahyoid muscles include the \\nomohyoid, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid.\\nAnother neck muscle, the sternocleidomastoid,\\nattaches from the mastoid process of the temporal bone \\nto the sternum (breastbone) and clavicle (collarbone). \\nThe area around this muscle is palpated during a can-\\ncer-screening exam since the chain of cervical (neck) \\nlymph nodes surrounds this muscle (Fig. 14-35).\\nC. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING TOOTH \\nPOSITION OR MOVEMENT\\nOther factors affecting relative tooth positions and move-\\nments include the ligaments, fascia, and, to a certain \\nextent, the muscles of facial expression. The ligaments,\\nincluding the capsular, temporomandibular, styloman-\\ndibular, and sphenomandibular ligaments (recall Figs. \\n14-23 and 14-24), provide some limits to protrusive, \\nlateral, and opening movements of the mandible.\\nFascia [FASH e ah] is also thought to limit move-\\nment of the mandible to some extent. Fascia is connec-\\ntive tissue that forms sheets or bands between anatomic \\nstructures. It attaches to bones and surrounds muscles, \\nglands, vessels, nerves, and fat.\\nSome muscles of facial expression  (especially in the \\nlips and cheeks) and the tongue muscles are thought to \\ninfluence development, position, and shape of the den-\\ntal arches. The muscles of facial expression are shown \\nin Figure 14-36 and include the following:\\nOrbicularis oris•  [or BIK u LAR is O ris] is located \\nwithin the lips around the opening of the mouth and \\nacts to close or purse the lips (as around a straw or \\naround a saliva ejector within the dental office).\\nLEARNING EXERCISE\\nViewing the inferior surface of a skull with a movable \\nmandible, imagine elastic bands attached from the \\nlocation of the origins to the insertions of the lateral \\npterygoid muscles, right and left sides. Since the \\norigin on the base of the skull stays stationary, but \\nthe mandible at the insertion attachment can move, \\nconfirm that the mandible moves anterior and infe-\\nrior if both elastic bands were contracted (short-\\nened). Next, see what would happen if only one \\nband was shortened (contracted). If only the right \\nside is shortened, the right condyle moves medially \\n(to the left), closer to its origin on the lateral ptery-\\ngoid plate, so the body of the mandible and its teeth \\nalso move toward the left side. Practice this until \\nyou understand why the jaw moves the way it does \\nwhen one lateral pterygoid muscle works. Next, \\nattempt to palpate the origin of the lateral pterygoid \\nmuscle in your mouth. Slip a clean little finger into \\nyour mouth along the lateral surface of the maxil-\\nlary alveolar process. Then gently move the finger \\nposteriorly and medially, around to the posterior \\nsurface of the maxilla, and superiorly toward the \\nlateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate where \\nthe lateral pterygoid muscle attaches. Moving the \\nmandible toward the side you are palpating will give \\nyour finger more room to reach the muscle. This \\npalpation may be slightly uncomfortable.'),\n",

TRIGEMINAL NERVE (FIFTH CN)\\nWhen discussing the function of the oral cavity, \\n probably the most important nerve is the trigeminal. \\nThe trigeminal nerve or fifth CN is the largest of the \\nCNs and is the major sensory nerve of the face and \\nscalp. It originates in the large semilunar or trigeminal \\nganglion, a group of nerve cell bodies located on the \\nsuperior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal \\nbone in a small depression (the semilunar fossa) medial \\nto the foramen ovale. The trigeminal nerve divides into \\nthree major divisions (or three nerve branches). (Hint: \\n“tri” in trigeminal refers to the nerve’s three divisions.) \\nDivision I  (the ophthalmic [ahf THAL mik] nerve) \\nand Division II  (the maxillary nerve ) are only affer-\\nent (sensory). Division III (the mandibular nerve) is \\nboth afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor). Its effer-\\nent fibers supply the muscles of mastication. This is the \\nonly CN with sensory (touch and pain) innervation to \\nthe skin of the face, and the divisions or branches are \\ndistributed to the face as shown in Figure 14-37.\\nThe maxillary and mandibular divisions of the \\ntrigeminal nerve also supply afferent or sensory neu-\\nrons that provide the brain with information about the \\nposition of the teeth and jaws at all times. The inter-\\npretation of postural information by the brain (sense \\nof position) is called proprioception. Proprioceptive \\nnerve receptors are located in muscles and ligaments, \\nincluding the periodontal ligaments, and in the lateral \\naspects of the TMJs. The periodontal ligament around \\neach tooth is well supplied with proprioceptive neu-\\nrons from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of \\nthe trigeminal nerve. These branches send messages to \\nthe brain as to the relative position of the mandibular \\nto maxillary teeth. This has a tremendous influence on \\nrelative jaw position, movement, and occlusion (the fit-\\nting together) of the teeth. Canines are reported to have \\nthe richest supply of proprioceptive nerve endings.\\nThe TMJ also has proprioceptive neurons in the cap-\\nsule and disc that are innervated by the auriculotempo-\\nral branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal \\nnerve. To a great extent, proprioceptive information, \\nespecially from the teeth, determines the subcon-\\nscious but well-coordinated function of the two com-\\nplex TMJs.\\n24,25 Otherwise, we could experience many \\nunpleasant tooth interferences or frequent joint pain.\\nEach of the three divisions is divided into many \\nbranches. The branches of the maxillary nerve and the \\nmandibular nerve are those that innervate the region \\nof, and around, the oral cavity and will be discussed in \\nthe most depth in this section.\\n1. DIVISION I (OPHTHALMIC NERVE) \\nOF THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE\\nThe ophthalmic [of THAL mik] nerve exits from the \\nskull by way of the superior orbital fissure on the supe-\\nrior surface of the orbit ( Fig. 14-38). It has three main \\nbranches: the smallest lacrimal nerve, the largest fron-\\ntal nerve, and the nasociliary nerve. The distribution of \\nthese sensory branches that supply the skin of the face \\nis shown in Figure 14-37. The ophthalmic nerve and its \\nbranches supply general sensations (of touch, pain, pres-\\nsure, and temperature) to the skin of the upper third of \\nFIGURE 14-37. General distri-\\nbution to the skin of the three \\nsensory divisions of the trigemi-\\nnal nerve. Pain in these areas is \\nfelt by impulses sent through the \\nophthalmic (yellow), maxillary \\n(green), and mandibular \\nbranches (red) or divisions of \\nthis nerve.

The \\nophthalmic nerve does not supply the oral cavity. (Hint: \\n“Ophthalmic” is related to the eye; compare ophthal-\\nmologist, a physician who specializes in eyes.)\\n2. DIVISION II (MAXILLARY NERVE) \\nOF THE TRIGEMINAL NERVE\\nThe maxillary nerve  provides general sensations (of \\ntouch, pain, pressure, and temperature) to the skin of \\nthe middle third of the face and the palate (Fig. 14-37), \\nplus provides sensory branches to the pulp of all maxil-\\nlary teeth. It exits the brain case of the skull through the \\nforamen rotundum (Fig. 14-38). After passing through \\nthe foramen rotundum, the maxillary nerve passes \\ninto the pterygopalatine space and eventually splits into \\nfour branches: the pterygopalatine, posterior superior \\n alveolar (PSA), infraorbital, and zygomatic nerves.\\na. First Branch of the Maxillary Nerve: \\nPterygopalatine Nerve\\nThe first branch of the maxillary nerve, the pterygopala-\\ntine nerve, splits off closest to the foramen rotundum. \\nA branch of this nerve, called the descending palatine \\nnerve, passes through the greater palatine foramen  to \\nbecome the greater palatine nerve. The greater palatine \\nnerve spreads anteriorly to supply the mucosa (soft  tissue \\ncovering) of the posterior portion of the hard  palate and \\nthe palatal gingiva medial to the posterior teeth (molars \\nand premolars) (some red lines in Fig. 14-39). Just poste-\\nrior to the greater palatine foramen, the middle and pos-\\nterior (lesser) palatine nerves enter the palate through \\nthe lesser palatine foramen to spread posteriorly to sup-\\nply the tonsils and mucosa of the soft palate.\\nAnother long branch of the pterygopalatine nerve, \\nthe nasopalatine nerve, runs along the roof of the nasal \\ncavity, then diagonally downward and anteriorly along \\nthe nasal septum where it enters the bone of the palate \\nto emerge onto the anterior palate through the incisive \\nforamen. This branch innervates the soft tissue of the \\nnasal septum and gingiva and palatal soft tissue lingual \\nto the anterior teeth. The right and left nasopalatine \\nnerves combined with the greater palatine nerves inner-\\nvate the soft tissue of the entire hard palate (shown as \\nall red lines in Fig. 14-39).\\nb. Second Branch of the Maxillary Nerve: \\nPosterior Superior Alveolar (PSA) Nerve\\nJust before the maxillary nerve branch enters the \\ninfraorbital fissure and canal on the floor of the orbit, it \\ngives off its second branch, the PSA nerve. This branch \\nenters the alveolar canals on the infratemporal portion \\nof the maxilla (Fig. 14-40). Once within the trabecular \\n(spongy) bone of the maxilla and the maxillary sinus, its \\ndental branches enter small openings in the tooth roots \\nto supply the maxillary molars (except for one root, \\nFIGURE 14-38.

Third Branch of the Maxillary Nerve: \\nInfraorbital Nerve\\nIn the pterygopalatine space, a third branch of the max-\\nillary nerve splits off and passes through the inferior \\norbital fissure on the floor of the orbit and enters the \\ninfraorbital canal, where it becomes the infraorbital \\nnerve (Fig. 14-40). While within this canal, the infraor-\\nbital nerve gives off two branches, the middle superior \\nalveolar (MSA) and the anterior superior alveolar (ASA) \\nnerves (shown in Fig. 14-40).\\nThe MSA nerve passes forward along the lining of \\nthe maxillary sinus. It gives off small dental branches \\nthat enter premolars through their root openings \\n( apical foramina) to supply the maxillary premolars \\n(and the mesiobuccal root of the maxillary first molar), \\nsupporting alveolar bone, periodontal ligaments, and \\nfacial gingiva in the maxillary premolar region and part \\nof the maxillary sinus. It is important to realize that \\nthe nerve supplying primary teeth is the same as that \\nto the permanent teeth that replace them. Therefore, \\nthe nerve branch to the primary molars is the MSA, the \\nsame one that supplies their successors, the permanent \\npremolars.\\nThe second branch given off of the infraorbital \\nnerve while in the infraorbital canal is the ASA nerve. \\nIts small dental branches supply the pulp, supporting \\nalveolar bone, periodontal ligaments, and facial gingiva \\nof the maxillary anterior teeth and part of the maxillary \\nsinus.\\nNotice that three branches of the maxillary nerve \\nof CN V innervate all maxillary teeth: the PSA nerve, \\nthe MSA nerve, and the ASA nerve.

Another branch, the infraorbital nerve, passes from the pterygopalatine space to the floor of the eye orbit (which also \\nforms the roof of the maxillary sinus) where it enters the infraorbital canal (not shown). Within the infraorbital canal, two branches \\nsplit off to pass downward along the walls of the maxillary sinus and into the maxilla. The MSA nerve passes through the spongy bone \\nof the maxilla to the maxillary premolars (and one first molar root on each side), and the ASA passes to the roots of the maxillary \\nanterior teeth.

Other \\nbranches enter all mandibular teeth.\\nThe mandibular nerve exits the neurocranium \\nthrough the foramen ovale (Fig. 14-38). It passes into \\na space just medial to the zygomatic arch and mandibu-\\nlar ramus, and inferior to the temporal bone, called the \\ninfratemporal space. As it passes inferiorly toward the \\nmandibular foramen in the mandible, it divides into \\nfour sensory branches: the auriculotemporal, buccal, \\nlingual, and inferior alveolar nerves.\\na. Auriculotemporal Nerve\\nThe first branch of the mandibular division, the auricu-\\nlotemporal [aw RIK u lo TEM po ral] nerve, comes off \\nthe main trunk immediately below the base of the skull, \\nturning backward to supply pain and proprioception \\nfibers to the TMJ, and to supply the skin of the outer ear \\nand the lateral aspect of the skull and cheek (Fig 14-41).\\nb. Buccal (Buccinator) Nerve\\nAnother branch is the buccal (buccinator [BUCK sin a \\ntor] or long buccal) nerve, which comes off just below \\nthe foramen ovale and passes through the infratemporal \\nspace between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid mus-\\ncles, then down and forward to the buccinator muscle \\n(Fig. 14-41) where it innervates the mucosa and skin of \\nthe cheek up to the corner of the mouth, and the buccal \\ngingiva in the area of the mandibular molars and some-\\ntimes the second premolars. The best place to anesthetize \\nthe tissue supplied by the buccinator nerve is to inject \\ninside the cheek to deposit the anesthetic into the bucci-\\nnator muscle near the mandibular molars (Fig. 14-42).\\nFIGURE 14-41. Mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve branches (yellow) : The external wall of the right mandible has been \\nremoved to expose the inferior alveolar nerve within the mandible, where it gives off the many small branches to each mandibular \\ntooth. (From this view, the buccinator muscle hides the teeth.) Within the mandible near the premolar area, the inferior alveolar \\nnerve splits into two end (terminal) branches. One branch, the mental nerve, exits through the mental foramen to innervate the skin \\nof the chin and lip on that side, while the other branch is really a continuation of the inferior alveolar nerve anteriorly within the man-\\ndible where it is called the incisive nerve (not visible here). Also, note the other major branches of the mandibular division: the lingual \\nnerve, which is in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve posteriorly, but then diverges anteriorly to enter the tongue; and the \\nbuccal nerve, which innervates the cheek and tissue next to mandibular molars. Other nerve branches (not shaded) are motor \\nbranches of the mandibular nerve supplying the muscles of mastication. (Motor branches can be seen entering the masseter and \\ntemporalis muscles.)

Lingual Nerve\\nThe next branch of the mandibular nerve, given off \\ninferior to the foramen ovale, is the lingual nerve  \\nbranch that goes to the tongue (Figs. 14-41 and 14-42). \\nIt passes downward, medial to the ramus but lateral to \\nthe medial pterygoid muscle, to the mucous membrane \\njust lingual to the last molar. The lingual nerve pro-\\nvides general sensation (touch, pain, pressure, and tem-\\nperature, but not taste) to the top (dorsal) and bottom \\n(ventral) surfaces of the anterior two thirds of the tongue \\nand adjacent tissues. The adjacent tissues include the \\nsoft tissue (mucosa) on the floor of the mouth and \\ninner surface of the mandible and the lingual gingiva of \\nthe entire mandible.\\nd. Inferior Alveolar Nerve\\nFinally, the inferior alveolar nerve comes off the man-\\ndibular nerve on the medial side of the lateral ptery-\\ngoid muscle (Figs. 14-41 and 14-42). This large nerve \\nroughly parallels the direction of the lingual nerve to \\ndescend between the sphenomandibular ligament and \\nramus to the mandibular foramen, where it gives off the \\nmylohyoid nerve and then enters the mandible through \\nthe mandibular foramen  (represented on the medial \\nsurface of the mandible in Fig. 14-42). The mylohyoid \\nnerve (efferent) pierces the sphenomandibular liga-\\nment and travels forward in the mylohyoid groove to \\nsupply the mylohyoid muscle.\\nOnce the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandible \\nthrough the mandibular foramen, it is in the mandibu-\\nlar canal within the body of the mandible, where it gives \\noff the many small dental branches that spread through \\ntrabecular (spongy) bone of the mandible in order to \\nenter the apical foramen of all mandibular molars and \\npremolars. It also innervates the periodontal ligaments \\nand alveolar processes of these teeth. While within the \\nmandibular canal, the inferior alveolar nerve splits near \\nthe roots of the premolars to become the mental nerve \\nand the incisive nerve. The incisive nerve (Fig. 14-43) \\nbranch continues forward within the mandibular canal \\nto supply the mandibular incisor and canine teeth, \\ntheir periodontal ligaments, and surrounding alveolar \\nprocess. The mental nerve branch of the inferior alveo-\\nlar nerve exits from the body of the mandible through \\nthe mental foramen (Fig. 14-41) and supplies the facial \\ngingiva of the mandibular incisors, canines, and pre-\\nmolars and the mucosa and skin of the lower lip and \\nchin on that side up to the midline (Fig. 14-37).\\nNote that if an anesthetic solution is deposited next \\nto the opening of the mandibular foramen , it could \\nblock the passage of sensory nerve signals from all \\nmandibular teeth on that side (by blocking the inferior \\nalveolar and its terminal incisive branch) and also the \\nskin of the chin and lip area (because another termi-\\nnal branch, the mental nerve, has also been blocked). \\nFurther, since the lingual nerve is in close proxim-\\nity to the mandibular foramen, its fibers may also be \\nblocked, causing that side of the floor of the mouth, \\nlingual gingiva, and anterior two thirds of the tongue to \\nlose feeling. The only part of the mandible that would \\nnot be numb would be the tissue buccal to the molars, \\nwhich requires some additional anesthetic solution in \\nthe cheek to block the buccal nerve.\\nFIGURE 14-42. Location of the branches of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (mandibular nerve) (in red): As the man-\\ndibular nerve passes through the infratemporal space, it gives off the buccal nerve to the cheek (lateral to the ramus).

FACIAL NERVE (SEVENTH CN)\\nThe facial nerve is a mixed nerve (sensory and motor). \\nFrom the brain, the facial nerve penetrates the petrous \\nportion of the temporal bone through the internal \\nacoustic meatus (Fig. 14-45) and exits from the skull \\nbetween styloid and mastoid processes through the \\nstylomastoid foramen  ( Fig. 14-46 ). It passes through \\nthe parotid gland. Efferent motor  [EF er ent] fibers \\ninnervate muscles of facial expression (including the \\norbicularis oris) and visual expression of the face and \\nthe scalp. Other muscles supplied by the facial nerve \\ninclude the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and \\nstylohyoid muscle (Fig. 14-35); the platysma muscle (a \\nbroad, thin superficial muscle that covers much of the \\nanterior part of the neck, seen in Fig. 14-36); and the \\nstapedius muscle (in middle ear cavity). None of these \\nmuscles has any influence on moving the mandible. \\nEfferent secretory fibers stimulate secretions from two \\npairs of salivary glands: the sublingual glands  located \\njust under the mucosa in the floor of the mouth superior \\nto the mylohyoid muscle, and the submandibular glands \\nlocated in the submandibular fossae on the medial sur-\\nface of the mandible inferior to the mylohyoid muscle.\\nAfferent sensory  [AF er ent] fibers of the facial \\nnerve (chorda tympani branch ) branch off within the \\npetrous portion of the temporal bone. They course \\nthrough the tympanic cavity eventually exiting of the \\nskull by way of the petrotympanic [PET ro tim PAN ik] \\nfissure. These chorda tympani fibers of the facial nerve \\njoin with the lingual nerve (branch of the mandibular \\ndivision of the trigeminal nerve) and supply the sense \\nof taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue (the body \\nand the tip of the tongue).\\nFIGURE 14-43.

This is an important landmark to be aware of \\nso that you will be able to stop the flow of blood to the \\nlower part of the face in an emergency. Try to find the \\nfacial artery in the antegonial notch with your finger or \\nthumb. You should feel the pulse of the facial artery if \\nyou are in the correct spot. From here, the facial artery \\ngoes upward over the outer surface of the mandible to \\nthe face.\\nThere are four branches of the facial artery that will \\nbe described here. The ascending palatine artery comes \\noff at the highest point of the first bend of the facial \\nartery before it passes onto the face, and it ascends to \\nsupply structures adjacent to the pharynx (including \\nthe soft palate, the pharyngeal muscles, the mucosa of \\nthe pharynx, and the palatine tonsil). The submental \\nartery, which converges with the mylohyoid nerve, \\nsupplies structures in the floor of the mouth (such as \\nthe mylohyoid muscle, anterior belly of the digastric \\nmuscle, and lymph nodes inferior to the mylohyoid \\nmuscle). After passing onto the face, the inferior and \\nsuperior labial arteries (Fig. 14-48) surround and sup-\\nply the lips and the orbicularis oris muscle. Lateral \\nnasal and angular arteries are the terminal branches of \\nthe facial arteries.\\nThere is considerable merging at the midline of the \\narteries from both sides of the face, rather than the more \\nconventional system whereby an artery terminates with \\nmany small capillaries. This merging of small arteries \\nfrom opposite sides is called an end-to-end  anastomosis \\n[a NAS te MO sis]. One example is where the right \\nand left superior and inferior labial arteries join at the \\nmidline. As one might guess, such an anastomosis can \\ncause problems in arresting hemorrhage on the face.\\nThe third branch of the external carotid artery is the \\nmaxillary artery , which is probably the most impor-\\ntant artery to the dentist and dental hygienist. It arises \\nfrom the external carotid within the parotid gland (Fig. \\n14-48). The branches of this artery can be considered \\nin three parts as shown in Figure 14-49. The branches \\nof the mandibular and pterygopalatine part (or first and \\nthird parts) are directly involved with the blood supply \\nto the mandibular and maxillary teeth, respectively . The \\nbranches of the pterygoid part (or middle part) provide \\nblood to the four pairs of muscles of mastication. Study \\nFigure 14-49 as you read about the following branches \\nof each part of the maxillary artery . Also, notice the sim-\\nilarity between the names of the vessels and the names \\nof the nerves that supply the same structures.\\nMandibular Part of the Maxillary Artery• : Arteries to \\nthe Mandible\\nBranches coming off of the mandibular (or first) \\npart of the maxillary artery supply the mandibu-\\nlar teeth and their periodontal ligaments. You read \\ncorrectly: branches of the maxillary artery supply \\nthe mandible. The inferior alveolar artery , which, \\nlike the inferior alveolar nerve , enters the mandible \\nthrough the mandibular foramen, supplies branches \\nto the mandibular molars and premolars. It then \\ndivides into two branches: the mental artery, which \\nexits from the mental foramen to the lower lip \\nFIGURE 14-48.

While within \\nthe infraorbital canal, the infraorbital artery, like the \\ninfraorbital nerve, gives off the MSA artery that sup-\\nplies the premolars, and the ASA artery, which sup-\\nplies the anterior teeth. Each descending palatine  \\nbranch of the maxillary artery supplies part of the \\nnasal cavity before it emerges onto the palate through \\nthe greater palatine foramen (Fig. 14-39) like the \\nnerves to supply the mucosa of the hard and soft pal-\\nate and the lingual gingiva. Its terminal part ascends \\nthrough the incisive canal into the nasal cavity .\\nThe TMJ is supplied with oxygenated blood from \\nfive branches: the ascending pharyngeal (not visible \\nin  figure) and superficial temporal branches of the \\n external carotid artery and by the anterior tympanic, \\nmasseteric, and middle meningeal branches of the max-\\nillary artery (Fig. 14-49).\\nB. VEINS\\nVeins tend to be straighter than arteries. 30,31 In many \\ninstances, they travel almost the same course as \\n arteries. There are no valves in any of the facial veins. \\nTherefore, an infection in the face can travel through \\nveins in either direction. Veins that drain blood from \\nthe face on its way back to the heart are shown in \\nFigure 14-50.\\nNumerous veins drain blood from the maxillary and \\nmandibular teeth and adjacent tissues into a pterygoid \\nplexus. The pterygoid [TER i goid] plexus is a network \\nof veins medial to the upper part of the ramus of the \\nmandible, located between the temporal and lateral \\npterygoid muscles, or between the lateral and medial \\npterygoids.\\n31 This plexus collects blood through deep \\nveins that drain the upper part of the face, the tissue \\nof the lips and muscles around the mouth, the poste-\\nrior part of the nasal cavity , the palate, the maxillary \\nalveolar process, and maxillary teeth. Also, inferior \\nalveolar veins (not visible in Fig. 14-50) carry blood to \\nthe pterygoid plexus from the mandible and its teeth, \\nthat is, from the area of the oral cavity supplied by the \\ninferior alveolar artery (and the area innervated by the \\ninferior alveolar nerve).

Blood from the tongue drains through \\nlingual veins (not visible on Fig. 14-50) that also emp-\\nties into the internal jugular vein (possibly via the com-\\nmon facial vein).\\nVenous drainage of the face becomes even more \\ncomplex when you consider that there is a deep facial \\nvein, which connects the deeper pterygoid plexus with \\nthe more superficial facial vein. Since the deep facial \\nvein has no valves, blood from the head can make its \\nway down to the internal jugular vein either through the \\npterygoid plexus and retromandibular vein, or through \\nthe facial vein and its branches.\\nOnce blood reaches the internal jugular vein , it \\npasses into the brachiocephalic vein, to the superior \\nvena cava, then through the heart and lungs to become \\noxygenated before being pumped back to the mouth \\n(Fig. 14-47).\\nFIGURE 14-50.

LYMPH VESSELS\\nThe lymph system is somewhat more complex32 since it \\nserves to collect tissue fluid that got outside the blood \\ncapillary bed and then return this fluid to the vascu-\\nlar system. In the arterial side of a capillary bed, blood \\npressure exceeds osmotic pressure, so fluid escapes \\ninto the tissue spaces. On the venous side of each capil-\\nlary bed, the blood pressure is lower, and the osmotic \\npressure becomes higher, forcing 90% of the tissue \\nfluid back into the venous capillary bed.\\n33 The major \\nbulk of the remaining 10% of the fluid is the lymph, \\nwhich passes into the lumen of lymph capillaries and is \\nthen collected in the nodes (shown in Fig. 14-51) and \\nreturned to the blood vascular system.\\nDuring times of infection, trauma, or cancerous \\ngrowth, abnormal amounts of fluids escape (along \\nwith specialized cells to fight infection, etc.), and this \\nresults in swollen lymph glands. Since lymph nodes \\nform chains that are then connected by lymph vessels, \\ninfection spreads predictably from the site of infection \\nto a specific lymph node, which then drains to another \\nuntil the lymph system empties back into the veins. \\nThe spread pattern is as follows. Refer to Figure 14-51 \\nwhile reading.\\nInfection in the area of the chin and adjacent struc-\\ntures including the tip of the tongue and tissues sur-\\nrounding the mandibular incisors—anterior floor of the \\nmouth, lower lip, and adjacent gingiva (gum tissue)—\\nall drain into the submental nodes just lingual to the \\nmandibular symphysis area. When enlarged, these \\nnodes can be palpated just posterior to the symphysis \\narea of the mandible.\\nThe submandibular chain of nodes  is located over \\nthe surface of the submandibular salivary gland and \\ncan be palpated medial but anterior to the angle of the \\nmandible, with the most prominent node in this chain \\nlocated over the facial artery medial to the antegonial \\nnotch.

GENERAL APPEARANCE\\nThe first thing to notice during an initial meeting with a \\npatient is his or her general appearance. You can obtain \\nclues regarding possible health problems that have not \\nyet been diagnosed, and you can begin to predict how \\nwell the patient will tolerate dental treatment. Notice \\nthe posture, gait, breathing, and general well-being \\nduring your greeting.\\nB. HEAD\\nA close look at the head may reveal asymmetry of the \\nhead or a discrepancy in the relationship of the upper \\nand lower jawbones. This could be important to iden-\\ntify swelling that could be a sign of pathology or infec-\\ntion, and when determining how to identify and treat \\nproblems with the occlusion.\\nC. SKIN AND UNDERLYING MUSCLES \\nOF MASTICATION\\nObserve the skin for any unusual lesions, and describe \\neach lesion by location (relative to adjacent normal \\nlandmarks), size, and the person’s knowledge of its his-\\ntory. The evaluator’s knowledge of pathology will be \\nhelpful when distinguishing benign lesions from those \\nrequiring follow-up pathology consult and/or biopsy.\\nMuscles of the head and neck may be palpated to \\nidentify pain or tenderness that could be related to \\nproblems with the temporomandibular joint or an \\nimbalance in the occlusion of the teeth (made worse \\nwhen the person habitually clenches or squeezes the \\nteeth together). For this reason, it is important to be \\nable to locate and palpate these muscles where pos-\\nsible. You can palpate each muscle pair bilaterally by \\nlightly massaging an area with the middle finger of each \\nhand while using the index and fourth finger to pal-\\npate surrounding soft tissue to feel for unusual lumps \\nor tenderness. Palpate these muscles on a partner while \\nusing Figure 15-1 as a guide.\\nMasseter• : Feel the body of the masseter by palpat-\\ning the bulge over the lateral surface of the mandible \\nnear the angle while your partner clenches the jaws \\ntogether. Move your finger down toward the angle of \\nthe mandible to feel the insertion (labeled No. 4 on \\nFig. 15-1), and move up toward the zygomatic arch \\n(inferior border of the zygomatic bone and zygo-\\nmatic process of the temporal bone) to feel the origin\\n(labeled No. 3)\\nMedial pterygoid• : Feel the bulge when your partner \\nclenches while palpating the medial surface of the \\nangle of the mandible at the insertion (labeled No. 7). \\nIt may help to have your partner lean the head for-\\nward to relax the skin of the neck as you gently pal-\\npate upward and outward against the medial surface \\nof the mandible near the angle, using the tips of your \\nmiddle finger and forefinger. This may cause some \\ndiscomfort.\\nEXTRAORAL EXAMINATION: NORMAL STRUCTURESSECTION I\\nFIGURE 15-1.

Since these muscle fibers are \\ninvolved in retruding the mandible, see if you can \\nfeel a bulge when your partner retrudes (pulls back) \\nthe mandible.\\nLateral pterygoid•  (intraoral palpation): The lateral \\npterygoid can only be palpated intraorally . Feel this \\nmuscle by placing your little finger in the vesti-\\nbule of the mouth behind the maxillary tuberosity \\n(labeled No. 8). (Use a skull to see how to reach the \\nlateral plate of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid \\nbone.) With your partner’s mouth slightly open and \\nthe mandible moved slightly toward the side being \\npalpated, slide your little finger back toward the lat-\\neral pterygoid plate for the origin of the lateral ptery-\\ngoid muscle. This may be uncomfortable to a patient \\neven if the muscle is not sore. The anterior surface \\nof the neck of the condyloid process is the location \\nof part of the insertion of this muscle, but it cannot \\nbe palpated.\\nD. EYES\\nThe normally white part of the eyes (sclera) should be \\nwhite and clear, not bloodshot, and not yellow (a pos-\\nsible indication of jaundice from liver disease). The \\nthin layer of tissue covering the eyeball and reflected \\nonto the inner surfaces of the eyelids (called the con-\\njunctiva) should appear healthy and not be severely \\ninflamed (red) or irritated (a possible sign of allergy or \\ndisease). The pupil (dark center opening surrounded \\nby the colored iris) should not be severely pinpoint \\nor dilated, both of which may be signs of disease or \\ndrug use.\\nE. TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT\\nLocate and palpate the lateral aspects of both man-\\ndibular condyles simultaneously by standing behind \\nyour partner and pressing your middle fingers over \\nthe skin just anterior to the external opening of the \\near and inferior to the zygomatic arch while your \\npartner opens wide and closes (Fig. 15-1, labeled No. \\n1). Feel the head of the condyle move as your part-\\nner opens and closes the mandible and moves the \\nmandible from side to side. Movement of the condyles \\nduring minimal opening of the mandible cannot be \\nfelt as easily as when the mouth is opened wide since \\nthe condyles and mandible only rotate around a line \\nconnecting the condyles (like a swing) during mini-\\nmal opening, but the condyles and mandible move \\nbodily (translate forward and downward over the \\narticular eminences) when opening wide. Also, feel \\nthe condyles during lateral movement to see if you \\ndiscern differences in movement on the right side ver-\\nsus the left side during movement to the right, then \\nmovement to the left. Sometimes you may feel a jerky \\nmovement accompanied by a clicking or popping \\nsound. This is likely due to the head of the condyle \\nslipping off of the articular disc.\\nPalpate the posterior surface of the mandibular \\ncondyle by placing your little fingers into each exter-\\nnal auditory meatus (ear canal openings) and press \\nanteriorly forward (Fig. 15-1, labeled No. 2). Feel \\nthe posterior surface of the condyles as your partner \\nopens, closes, and moves the mandible laterally from \\nside to side.\\nF. NECK\\nThe neck should be evaluated for symmetry and to \\nconfirm that there are no lumps or bumps. The thy-\\nroid gland (a major gland that secretes the thyroid hor-\\nmone, which is responsible for controlling much of the \\nmetabolism of the body) is located in the neck. It is just \\ninferior to the voice box (larynx or laryngeal promi-\\nnence), and it is shaped somewhat like a butterfly with \\nwings extending laterally on either side of the larynx \\n(Fig. 15-2, labeled No. 17). This gland should be evalu-\\nated visually and palpated (as in Fig. 15-3) to ensure \\nthat there is no swelling (a possible goiter), which \\ncould be a sign of dysfunction of this gland and its out-\\nput of thyroid hormone. Lymph nodes in the neck that \\nare located around the sternocleidomastoid muscles are \\ndescribed next.\\nG. LYMPH NODES\\nThe evaluation of lymph nodes during a dental exam is \\nimportant since enlarged nodes may indicate infection \\nfrom sites that drain into them or may be an indicator \\nof the spread of cancer. Healthy nodes are normally not \\npalpable, but infection or malignancies may cause them \\nto become enlarged. A node that becomes palpable due \\nto an infection that drains into the node is more likely to \\nbe firm, tender, enlarged, and warm, and adjacent \\nskin may be reddened. In this case, look for the site \\nof infection based on your knowledge of the spread'),\n",

Other areas of the oral mucous \\nmembrane have no keratin layer so are more delicate \\nin structure, such as the cheeks and floor of the mouth. \\nThis mucosa lining may be so thin that the blood ves-\\nsels located in the underlying connective tissue may \\neasily be seen, giving it a reddish or bluish color.\\nMany of the nerves that innervate the teeth and \\n adjacent oral structures can be reached with the anes-\\nthetic syringe needle by penetrating the labial and buc-\\ncal mucosa. The landmarks that are helpful for locating \\nthese injection sites will be described throughout this \\nsection.\\nIn order for you to “feel” pain, the tooth or surrounding tissue that is being stimulated must pass the mes-\\nsage to the brain by way of the branches of the cranial nerves. When anesthetic is placed near a nerve, it can \\nspread (or infiltrate) through soft tissue or spongy bone to enter the nerve cells with sufficient concentration \\nto reduce pain messages being sent to the brain. Anesthetic, to be effective, must be placed at a location \\nalong the nerve between the tissues to be numbed and the brain. Therefore, it is important to recall the pas-\\nsageway of the nerves of the mouth to know where to apply the anesthetic in order to block the pain elicited \\nin the tissues being treated (such as tooth pulps and tissues surrounding the teeth) to keep the message \\nfrom reaching (and being “felt” by) the brain.\\nRecall that most nerves parallel arteries and veins. In order to avoid injecting local anesthetic into these \\nvessels where it can produce an exaggerated undesirable effect on the heart (systemic effect), an aspirat-\\ning syringe is used. This type of syringe permits the operator to pull back on the stopper of the anesthetic \\ncartridge and apply a negative pressure through the solution and needle. Therefore, if the needle tip is in \\na blood vessel, the negative pressure can aspirate (suck in) blood into the glass anesthetic cartridge where \\nit can be seen. When blood is observed, the operator can reposition the needle prior to injecting the anes-\\nthetic and aspirate again to ensure that the anesthetic will not enter the vessel where it would quickly reach \\nthe heart, resulting in an increased chance of undesirable side effects.\\nIn order for the anesthetic to block the signal of tooth pain being sent along the nerve branches that \\npass from each tooth to the brain, a sufficient concentration of anesthetic must enter the nerve cells along \\ntheir passageway from the tooth to the brain to block the nerve. In order to accomplish this, anesthetic is \\napplied as close as possible to a nerve before it enters the bone, or, if the bone is porous enough or thin \\nenough, it may be applied outside of the bone where it can pass (infiltrate) through the bone directly to the \\ndental nerve branches in the bone before they enter the tooth root. The maxillae bones are less dense than \\nthe mandible, permitting anesthetic to infiltrate more readily from adjacent soft tissue into bone and reach \\nnerve branches that enter the tooth pulps. In the mandible, nerves supplying the pulps can be blocked more \\neffectively by applying the anesthetic near the mandibular nerve before it enters the mandible (the inferior \\nalveolar nerve) or into the mental foramen (which permits the solution to enter the mandible and block only \\nthe inferior alveolar nerve branches to the premolars and possibly the anterior teeth but not the molars).\\nTECHNIQUE FOR INJECTING LOCAL ANESTHETIC TO NUMB ORAL \\nSTRUCTURES: BACKGROUND\\nA. LABIAL AND BUCCAL MUCOSA: \\nVESTIBULE AND CHEEKS\\nThe vestibule space between the teeth and the lips or \\ncheeks can be divided into the labial vestibule next \\nto the anterior teeth, and the buccal vestibule next to \\nthe posterior teeth (premolars and molars). It extends \\nsuperiorly into a mucosa-lined space next to maxil-\\nlary teeth, and inferiorly next to mandibular teeth. It is \\ncovered with dark pink-colored alveolar mucosa and is \\nrich in blood vessels and minor salivary glands. The tip \\nof your tongue can reach into each vestibule to assist \\nin cleaning the facial surfaces of the teeth, and while \\nchewing, to lift food back for additional chewing. The \\nvestibular fornix (seen later in Fig. 15-16) is the low-\\nest part of the vestibule next to the mandible or the \\nhighest part next to the maxillae. The vestibular fornix \\nnext to the cheeks is where food may collect in patients \\nwith nerve damage to the cheek (as with unilateral loss \\nof function of the facial nerve from Bell’s palsy or from \\na stroke).'),\n",

These are all branches of the maxillary division of the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve. In order \\nto anesthetize the pulp of one or two teeth, or the soft tissue in a specified area, it is necessary to block the \\nappropriate individual branches of the posterior superior alveolar (PSA), middle superior alveolar (MSA), or \\nASA nerve branches that innervate these tissues.\\nIf you want to anesthetize only the maxillary second or third molar and adjacent tissue, you can reach the \\nPSA (Fig. 15-7) before it enters the alveolar canals (Fig. 15-8) by directing the anesthetic toward the posterior \\nsurface of the maxilla, just superior, distal, and slightly medial to the apex of the third molar. Entry to this \\nsite is through the mucosa at the height of the buccal vestibule (vestibular fornix) superior to the maxillary \\ntuberosity (Fig. 15-9). The cheek can be stretched slightly outward to permit an angle that is directed superi-\\norly and medially. Specific dental branches of the PSA can also be blocked by depositing the anesthetic next \\nto the maxilla as close as possible to the apex of the tooth being anesthetized, and the solution will infil-\\ntrate through the maxillary bone to block the dental branches to these molars. When using this technique \\nto anesthetize a maxillary first molar, the anesthetic will not only reach the dental branches of the PSA that \\nenter two of its roots but also the MSA branches that enter the third root.\\nFor all other maxillary teeth and adjacent facial gingiva, you need to block branches of the MSA or ASA. \\nSince you cannot easily reach the MSA and ASA nerves as they pass from the brain through the base of the \\norbit and maxillary sinus, you can deposit the solution in the soft tissue of the vestibular fornix adjacent to \\nthe maxillae, at a level of the tooth root tips of the teeth you want to get numb (Figs. 15-10 for the MSA and \\n15-11 for the ASA). The anesthetic can infiltrate through the soft tissue and bone to reach dental nerve \\nbranches of the ASA (supplying the pulps of anterior teeth, Fig. 15-12) or MSA (supplying the pulps of pre-\\nmolars and one root [mesiobuccal] of the maxillary first molar, Fig. 15-13) in order to block pain. As stated \\npreviously, the anesthetic placed to block the MSA nerve branches may also infiltrate through the bone to \\nblock some of the PSA nerve branches, thereby numbing the entire first molar.\\nEnd branches of the infraorbital nerve branches that supply the soft tissue facial to premolars and ante-\\nrior teeth can be anesthetized using the infiltration technique described above. However, blocking all of the \\nterminal branches of the infraorbital nerve may also be helpful. This nerve can be reached by applying the \\nanesthetic near the opening of the infraorbital foramen (Fig. 15-14). This foramen may be palpated with the \\nforefinger through the skin just below the inferior border of the eye socket. Then, using the thumb in the \\nfacial vestibule to raise the upper lip, you can pass the needle into tissue at the height (fornix) of the vesti-\\nbule near the premolars (similar to the MSA injection) and continue to move the tip parallel to the facial \\nsurface of the maxilla until reaching the level of the infraorbital foramen (Fig. 15-15).\\nINJECTIONS FOR THE POSTERIOR, MIDDLE, AND ASA NERVES\\nRefer to Figure 15-16 as a guide while studying the \\nfollowing structures. The labial frenum [FREE num] \\n(plural: frena [FREE nah]) is the thin sheet of tissue at \\nthe midline that attaches each lip (upper and lower) to \\nthe mucosa covering the maxillae or mandible between \\nthe central incisors. The buccal frenum loosely attaches \\nthe cheek to the mucosa of the jaw in the area of the \\npremolars (maxillary and mandibular). These buccal \\nfrena can be seen by pulling the  lip and cheek out and \\nupward and the  lip and cheek out and downward. Facial \\nmuscles move the buccal frena forward and backward \\nand upward and downward during eating to help, along \\nwith the tongue, place our food back over the chewing \\nsurfaces of our teeth while eating. Movement of these \\nfrena can dislodge complete dentures if the denture bor-\\nder is designed improperly .\\nUsually 4 to 6 mm posterior to the commissure of \\nthe lips, a slight bulge of mucous membrane called the \\ncommissural papule  is commonly seen and may be \\npalpated (Fig. 15-16). The parotid papilla [pa ROT id \\npah PILL e] is a rounded flap of tissue on the mucosa of \\nthe cheek next to the maxillary first and second molars \\nat or just superior to the occlusal plane (Fig. 15-16). \\nThis papilla covers the parotid duct (Stensen’s duct) \\nopening.\\nA\\nThe lining of the buccal mucosa  on the inside of \\nthe cheeks is shiny, but in spots may be rough.

Recall that both of these \\nnerve branches split off of the maxillary nerve while in the pterygopalatine space, and then pass through \\nthe nasal passageways before entering the palatal tissue. The nasopalatine nerve passes from the pterygo-\\npalatine space along the nasal septum in the nasal cavity, and into palatal mucosa through the incisive fora-\\nmen (Fig. 15-23), which is located immediately under the bump of very firm tissue called the incisive papilla \\n(Fig. 15-24). This papilla is located on the palate just lingual to the midline between the maxillary central inci-\\nsors. Since this tissue is very firm, only a small amount of anesthetic can be applied into this tissue, and this \\ninjection can be most painful.

A small amount of anesthetic may be placed into this spongy tissue, resulting \\nin numbness of tissues adjacent to and anterior to the injection site (Fig. 15-26).\\nNote: It is also possible to reach the entire maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve just after it exits the \\ncranium through the foramen rotundum while it is still within the pterygopalatine space and anesthetize all \\nof the maxillary branches (called a second division block). This location is superior to the location of the PSA \\nblock already discussed. Anesthetic deposited in this location reduces pain to the structures supplied by \\nthe PSA, MSA, ASA, greater palatine, and nasopalatine nerves.

In order to reach the mandibular foramen, the needle penetrates the mucosa \\nof the pterygomandibular fold about 1/2 in. above the occlusal plane (Fig. 15-30). (On an edentulous patient, \\nuse the landmark of the retromolar pad and inject just slightly superior to it.) After penetration into the \\nmucosa, continue moving the needle tip parallel to the medial surface of the ramus until you reach the loca-\\ntion of the inferior alveolar nerve, that is, slightly beyond half way from the anterior to the posterior border \\nof the ramus. Recall that the internal surface of each ramus, when viewed from above, diverges wider as it \\ngoes posteriorly, so the handle of the syringe must be angled across the premolars on the opposite side in \\norder to parallel the medial surface of the ramus. This angle is evident in Figure 15-31 and can also be seen \\nin the mouth in Figure 15-30. If bone is touched before reaching the estimated depth of the foramen, or if \\nthe bone is not reached when you are well beyond the foramen, you need to pull back the needle, re-angle \\nthe syringe, and try again. If bone is reached at the estimated location of the inferior alveolar nerve, pull \\nback the needle very slightly to avoid damaging the bone, then aspirate to ensure you are not in a vessel, \\nand inject the anesthetic.\\nAnesthetic can be placed in small amounts at intervals while entering through the mucosa toward the \\nmandibular foramen (reaspirating each time) in order to reach the lingual nerve branch, which is next to \\nthe inferior alveolar nerve. Because the lingual nerve is located within the tissue adjacent to the mandibular \\nnerve (Fig. 15-32), the anesthetic can infiltrate through tissue to reach the lingual nerve and result in numb-\\nness to the anterior half of the tongue and adjacent lingual mucosa of the floor of the mouth on the side \\nbeing injected. Blocking the inferior alveolar nerve and lingual nerve should reduce pain in all mandibular \\nteeth and almost all surrounding tissues but should also numb half of the tongue and half of the lip on \\nthat side. The only area not numb would be the tissue just buccal to the molars, which is innervated by the \\n buccinator (long buccal) nerve (described earlier).\\nIf only tissue or teeth of mandibular premolars or anterior teeth need to be anesthetized, the anesthetic \\nsolution can be applied at the location of the mental foramen (Fig. 15-33). At this location in the mandible, \\nthe mental nerve branches off the inferior alveolar nerve and exits the mandible to spread anteriorly and \\ninnervate the lower lip and adjacent labial tissue. Just inside of this foramen, the inferior alveolar nerve \\ncontinues forward within the mandible as incisive branches to innervate the pulps of anterior teeth. This \\nforamen is normally palpable (and evident on radiographs) at a level between or near the root tips of the \\nmandibular premolars. The injection enters mucosa at the depth (fornix) of the buccal vestibule extending \\nto the level of the palpated foramen. Due to the posterior superior direction of the canal inside of the men-\\ntal foramen, it is best to direct the needle inferiorly and slightly from the distal (Fig. 15-33). An advantage \\nof this injection is that it does not numb any of the tongue, so it does not affect the ability of the person to \\nspeak as might occur with an inferior alveolar block that numbs the tongue on the side of the injection.\\nNote: It may also be possible to anesthetize only mandibular incisors by placing the anesthetic just labial \\nto the alveolar bone facial to the root tips of the mandibular anterior teeth. Even though the mandibular \\nbone is dense, this may be successful if the bone overlying these roots is quite thin. Using this technique, \\none can numb the mandibular facial tissue and anterior teeth, but neither this mandibular facial infiltration \\ntechnique nor the mental nerve block will numb the lingual tissue or tongue.\\nD. TONGUE\\nThe tongue is a broad, flat organ largely composed of \\nmuscle fibers and glands. It rests in the floor of the \\nmouth within the curved body of the mandible. The \\ntongue changes its shape with each functional move-\\nment. The anterior two thirds is called the body (the \\npart that is most visible during an intraoral examina-\\ntion of the tongue), and the posterior one third is the \\ntongue base or root (which is difficult to see in most \\nmouths since it is back so far). Recall that the body of \\nthe tongue is innervated for touch and pain by cranial \\nnerve V (the trigeminal nerve) and for taste by cra-\\nnial nerve VII (chorda tympani branches) of the facial \\nnerve. The base or root of the tongue is innervated for \\ntaste and feeling by cranial nerve IX (the glossopharyn-\\ngeal nerve). Examine the tongue by wrapping it in a \\ndamp gauze square to grab its slippery surface while \\ngently pulling it first to one side, then to the other. The \\ntongue muscles that may fight you in this endeavor are \\ninnervated by cranial nerve XII (hypoglossal nerve).'),\n",

DORSUM OF THE TONGUE\\nUse Figure 15-34 as a guide for landmarks on the dor-\\nsum (top) of the tongue. However, most people are \\nunable to stick their tongue as far forward as in this \\nillustration. The dorsum (dorsal or superior surface) of \\nthe tongue is the principal organ of taste and is invalu-\\nable during speech, mastication, and deglutition (swal-\\nlowing). The dorsum of the tongue is grayish-red and \\nis rough. It is covered by two kinds of papillae [pah \\nPILL e] or projections. The fine hair-like filiform papil-\\nlae, which are quite numerous, cover the anterior two \\nthirds of the dorsal surface of the tongue. The more \\nsparse, scattered, and shorter fungiform papillae  are \\neasy to identify because of their larger round shape \\nand deep red color ( Fig. 15-35 ). Fungiform papillae \\nget their name because they have a mushroom [fun-\\ngus] shape when viewed in cross section from the side. \\nFungiform papillae are most concentrated near the tip \\nof the tongue.\\n2\\nAnother type of papilla is also found near the junction \\nof the anterior two thirds and posterior one third of the \\ntongue. The circumvallate [ser kum VAL ate] papillae \\nare 8 to 12 prominent, flat, mushroom-shaped papillae \\nforming a V-shaped row on the dorsum near the poste-\\nrior third of the tongue (Fig. 15-35). Their walls contain \\nnumerous taste buds. The terminal sulcus is a shallow \\ngroove located just posterior to the circumvallate papil-\\nlae, and it separates the body of the tongue from the \\nroot of the tongue (Fig. 15-34). The foramen cecum \\n[SEE kum] is a small circular opening in the center of \\nthe terminal sulcus immediately posterior to the cir-\\ncumvallate papillae. This foramen is the remnant of the \\nthyroglossal duct from which the thyroid gland devel-\\noped. It is usually necessary to hold the tongue quite \\nFIGURE 15-34.

The lin-\\ngual frenum is a thin sheet of tissue at the midline that \\nattaches the undersurface of the tongue to the floor of \\nthe mouth. Look in a mirror and raise your tongue to \\nwatch how this tissue fold limits the amount of tongue \\nmovement.\\nD In a person who is tongue-tied, the lingual \\nfrenum is attached to mucosa on the lingual surface of \\nthe mandible perhaps only 3 or 4 mm inferior to the \\ngingival margins of the central incisors. Further, as the \\ntongue moves, this frenum could pull on the attached \\ngingiva, contributing to loss of attached gingiva and \\nsubsequent periodontal problems. A simple surgical \\nprocedure can change this area of attachment.\\nPlica fimbriata [PLY kah fim bri AH tah] (also called \\nfimbriated folds) are delicate fringes of mucous mem-\\nbrane on each side of the frenum on the ventral surface \\nof the tongue. The free edge of this fold may have a \\nseries of fringe-like processes. These are very delicate \\nFIGURE 15-35.

Also, feel for unusual lumps \\nby palpating the floor of the mouth with the forefinger \\nof one hand pressing against the floor and opposed out-\\nside of the mouth by a finger of the other hand. This \\nmethod of palpation is called bimanual palpation since \\nit requires two hands (Fig. 15-38).\\nLike the ventral surface of the tongue, the tissues of \\nthe floor of the mouth are shiny, and some large blood \\nvessels may be seen near the surface. The alveololin-\\ngual sulcus  (Fig. 15-37) is the broad, valley-shaped \\nspace between the mandibular alveolar bone and the \\ntongue. You can gently place your finger in this broad \\nsulcus and press laterally to confirm whether there are \\nany bony ridges on the medial surface of the mandible. \\nA prominent bump in this area might be a relatively \\ncommon occurrence: a mandibular torus.\\nA mandibular torus  (plural tori) ( Fig. 15-39 ) is a \\nbulbous protuberance of bone beneath a thin mucous \\nmembrane covering on the medial side of the  mandible \\noften found in the premolar region ( Fig. 15-40 ). \\nMandibular tori may be inherited as a genetic trait and \\nare not uncommon.

SALIVARY GLANDS (INTRAORALLY)\\nRefer to Figure 15-37 while studying these landmarks \\non the floor of the mouth. On the floor, the sublingual \\nfolds called the plica sublingualis  [PLY ka sub ling \\nGWAL is] extend anteriorly on each side of the floor \\nof the mouth from the first molar region to the lingual \\nfrenum. Along these folds are many small openings \\nof ducts from underlying sublingual salivary glands  \\nlocated in this region. These sublingual glands secrete \\npurely mucous saliva (ropy-type), producing only 5 to \\n8% of our saliva.\\n1\\nOn the midline at the junction between the right \\nand left sublingual folds, on either side of the lingual \\nfrenum, is a pair of bulges called sublingual carun-\\ncles (Fig. 15-40), each with an opening from ducts of \\nthe mandibular salivary glands  ( Wharton’s ducts ). \\nWharton’s ducts drain the large submandibular glands \\nlocated posteriorly on either side in the submandibu-\\nlar fossae of the internal surface of the mandible. These \\nglands produce about two thirds of our saliva.\\n1 Their \\nsecretions are primarily serous (two thirds serous cells, \\none third mucous cells\\n4). A person normally secretes \\nover a pint of saliva during 24 hours.E\\nIf you use bimanual palpation and gently move one \\nfinger in the floor of the mouth (opposing another \\noutside of the mouth) from posterior to anterior over \\nthe sublingual folds and the underlying submandibu-\\nlar ducts, saliva may flow out of the gland openings in \\nthe caruncles. Saliva may even squirt out of the mouth \\nthrough the openings in the caruncles when the patient \\nopens wide (like when you yawn during a boring lec-\\nture) and the surrounding muscles apply pressure to the \\nduct. It is possible for saliva to calcify within the ducts \\nand block the flow of saliva. This could cause symp-\\ntoms that get worse when eating since the saliva cannot \\nmake its way out of the ducts. This calcified blockage \\n(called a sialolith [si AL o lith]) may be palpated, con-\\nfirmed with a radiograph, and surgically removed.\\nG. ALVEOLAR PROCESS \\n(OF UNDERLYING BONE)\\nThe bone surrounding the roots of the teeth should be \\npalpated for bony growths (exostosis) or lesions.\\nH. GINGIVA\\nThe periodontium [per e o DON she um] was dis-\\ncussed in detail in Chapter 7 but is reviewed here in \\norder to emphasize the landmarks that can be identi-\\nfied in the mouth of a healthy person. Recall that the \\nperiodontium is comprised of the supporting tissues of \\nthe teeth, including surrounding alveolar bone, the gin-\\ngiva, the periodontal ligaments, and the outer layer of \\nthe tooth roots (covered with cementum). Evaluation \\nof the thickness of the periodontal ligament and the \\namount of alveolar bone surrounding each tooth \\nrequires appropriate radiographs. Recall that the peri-\\nodontal ligament is a very thin ligament composed of \\nmany fibers that connects the outer layer of the tooth \\nroot with the thin layer of dense bone (seen on a radio-\\ngraph as a white line called lamina dura) lining each \\nalveolus or tooth socket seen in Figure 15-42.

The apical, oblique, \\nhorizontal, and alveolar crest fibers  connect different \\nparts of the tooth root (cementum) to the dense bone \\nlining the tooth socket. The oblique fibers provide the \\nmajor support to the tooth during function. Free gingi-\\nval fibers are directed from tooth root (cementum) into \\nfree gingiva.

The zone closest to the tooth crown \\nis unattached gingiva, which includes the free gingiva \\nand the interdental papillae. Free gingiva (or marginal \\ngingiva) is the tissue that is not attached to the tooth \\nor alveolar bone. It surrounds each tooth to form a col-\\nlar of tissue with a potential space or gingival sulcus  \\n(crevice) hidden between it and the tooth. Free gin-\\ngiva extends from the free gingival margin  (the edge \\nof gingiva closest to the chewing or incising surfaces of \\nthe teeth) to the free gingival groove (visible in about \\none third of adults) that separates free gingiva from \\nattached gingiva. The interdental papilla  (interproxi-\\nmal papilla) [pah PILL ah] (plural is papillae [pa PILL \\nee]) is that part of the unattached gingiva between \\nadjacent teeth. A healthy papilla conforms to the space \\nbetween two teeth (interproximal space), so from the \\nfacial view it comes to a point near where the adjacent \\nteeth contact. The papilla also has the hidden sulcus \\n(potential space) next to each tooth where dental floss \\ncan fit once it passes between the teeth.\\nAttached gingiva  is a band or zone of gray to light \\nor coral pink (possibly with melanin pigmentation) \\nkeratinized masticatory mucosa that is firmly bound \\nto the underlying bone (Fig. 15-44). It extends \\nbetween the free gingiva (at the free gingival groove if \\npresent) and the more movable alveolar mucosa. The \\namount or width of attached gingiva varies normally \\nfrom 3 to 12 mm.\\nThe mucogingival line (junction)  (Fig. 15-44) is a \\nscalloped junction between attached gingiva and the \\nlooser, redder alveolar mucosa. Alveolar mucosa is mov-\\nable mucosa, dark pink to red, due to increased vascu-\\nlarity and more delicate nonkeratinized tissue just apical \\nto the mucogingival line. It is more delicate and less \\nfirmly attached to the underlying bone than the attached \\ngingiva and is more displaceable as well because of the \\nunderlying vessels and connective tissue. Palpate these \\ntwo types of tissues and you will feel the difference in \\nfirmness. This movable alveolar mucosa is found in three \\nplaces: in the maxillary and mandibular facial vestibule \\nand in the mandibular lingual aspects (alveolingual sul-\\ncus) but not on the palate, which has firm, attached ker-\\natinized tissue for almost the entire surface. Therefore, \\nthe mucogingival line is present on the facial aspects of \\nthe maxillary and mandibular gingiva but only on the \\nlingual aspect of mandibular gingiva.\\nFIGURE 15-43.

It is  widest \\non the facial (vestibular) aspect of maxillary anterior \\nteeth and the lingual aspect of mandibular molars. It is \\nnarrowest on the facial aspect of mandibular premolars.\\n5\\nThe gingival sulcus is not seen visually but can be \\nevaluated with a periodontal probe since it is actually \\na space (or potential space) between the tooth surface \\nand the narrow unattached cervical collar of free gingiva \\n(Fig. 15-45). The gingival sulcus is lined with the sul-\\ncular epithelium. It extends from the free gingival mar-\\ngin to the junctional epithelium. Clinically, the healthy \\ngingival sulcus ranges in probing depth from about 1 \\nto 3 mm and should not bleed when correctly probed. \\nJunctional (or attached) epithelium (seen in cross sec-\\ntion in Fig. 15-42) is a band of tissue at the most apical \\nportion of the gingival sulcus that attaches the gingiva \\nto the tooth. It is about 1 mm in width.\\n6 There is also \\na 1- to 1.5-mm connective tissue attachment to the root \\nabove the crest of bone. The periodontal probe usually \\npenetrates into the junctional epithelium, hence the \\ndifference between the depth determined through clini-\\ncal probing and the depth seen on a microscopic cross \\nsection.\\n7, F Sometimes, during the process of eruption of \\nthe mandibular last molar through the mucosa, a flap \\nof tissue may remain over part of the chewing surface \\ncalled an operculum (seen previously in Fig. 7.7). This \\noperculum can easily be irritated during chewing and \\nbecome infected.\\nI. THE TEETH: COUNT THEM\\nAn important part of the oral examination is to deter-\\nmine which teeth are erupted in the mouth, identify \\nthem by name or universal number, and determine \\nwhich teeth are missing. When the number of teeth \\nis fewer than expected for a patient, a careful history \\ncan confirm tooth loss by disease or accident or teeth \\nremoved prior to orthodontic treatment. When history \\ndoes not confirm such reasons for tooth loss, radio-\\ngraphs are recommended to rule out the possibility of \\nunerupted (impacted) teeth beneath the mucosa or sur-\\nrounded by bone (impacted teeth) or to confirm that a \\ntooth never formed. It is also possible for the patient to \\nhave extra (supernumerary) teeth or unexpected teeth \\n(such as retained primary teeth in a 30-year-old). These \\nfactors impact treatment planning decisions and should \\nbe documented.\\nThe total number of teeth depends on the age of the \\nindividual and the stage of development of the teeth. \\nRecall that the complete primary dentition consists of \\n20 teeth. From about 2 years old until almost 6 years \\nold, most children have all 20 primary teeth present \\nin the mouth but no permanent teeth. For the next \\n6 years, there is normally a mix of some primary and \\nsome permanent teeth (called mixed dentition with \\n24 teeth including the 4 permanent first molars) until \\nabout 12 years of age, when all primary teeth have \\nbeen lost and only permanent teeth are present. At age \\n12, there would normally be 28 permanent teeth (all \\nbut the unerupted third molars).

Of 662 parotid papillae, 78% were \\nlocated between the maxillary first and second \\nmolar or by the second molar. Only 22% were by \\nthe first molar. In height, 87% of these same  papillae \\nwere located level with (34%) or above the level \\n(53%) of the occlusal plane. Only 13% were found \\nbelow the level of the occlusal plane. The widest \\nvariation in location among these dental students \\nwas in two men, one having his parotid papilla \\non each side 11 mm above the occlusal plane and \\nthe other man with his 8 mm below the level of \\nthe occlusal plane. In a similar study of 293 adult \\nmen and 114 adult women (258 white, 11 black, \\n9 Hispanic), the parotid papilla averaged 3.3 mm \\nabove the occlusal plane (right 3.0, left 3.5 mm).\\n8'),\n",

There is a relatively constant 8.5-mm distance \\nfrom the facial surface of the maxillary central \\nincisors to the center of the incisive papilla. On \\n326 casts measured by Dr. Woelfel, the aver-\\nage distance was 8.4 mm, with a range of 5.5 to \\n12 mm.\\nC. Among casts from 939 hygiene students, rugae\\n“trees” had three, four, or five branches on each \\nside in 87% of the students. The first main branch \\nwas aligned lingual to the canine in 72%. The \\nrugae were well elevated in 85% of the students \\nand flattened in only 14%. Rugae are more dis-\\ntinct in young persons than in older persons. \\nHowever, a longitudinal study of 20 females and \\n21 males, from age 4 to 22 years, indicated a slight \\nbut steady growth in the length of rugae dur-\\ning this period (average: 1.4 to 2.3 mm). Rugae \\ngrowth occurred earlier in females, but the males \\nhad more branches.\\n9\\nD. Measurements on 333 casts by Dr. Woelfel \\nindicated the frenum attachment  to be 8.03 ± \\n1.5 mm below the gingival sulcus of the mandibular\\ncentral incisors; range 5.4 to 11 mm.

In a survey by Dr. Woelfel, 267 dental hygiene stu-\\ndents measured their gingival sulcus depths with a \\ncalibrated periodontal probe. The average gingival \\nsulcus depths for mandibular first molars midbuc-\\ncal were 1.5 ± 0.5 mm; midlingual: 1.7 ± 0.6 mm; \\nmesiolingual and distolingual: 2.5 ± 0.5 mm. These \\nmeasurements indicate that the gingival sulcus is \\nusually deeper interproximally. Similar measure-\\nments made on the mesiofacial aspect of man-\\ndibular canines (1.9 ± 0.8 mm), maxillary canines \\n(1.8 mm), maxillary first premolars (1.9 ± 0.7 mm), \\nand maxillary first molars (2.1 ± 0.7 mm) indicate \\nsulci slightly deeper on posterior teeth than those \\non anterior teeth.'),\n",

Although the crowns of both types of maxillary \\nincisors are longer cervicoincisally than mesiodis-\\ntally, maxillary central incisors are closer to square. \\nLateral incisors are more oblong cervicoincisally \\n(facial views).\\nb. On both maxillary incisors, the mesioincisal angles \\nare close to 90 degrees; the distoincisal angles are \\nmore rounded (facial views), but both angles are \\nmore rounded on the lateral compared to the central \\nincisor (facial views).\\nc. Incisal edges slope cervically toward the distal (facial \\nviews), more so on lateral incisors (facial views).\\nd. Maxillary central incisors have crowns and roots closer \\nto the same length. Lateral incisors have proportion-\\nately longer roots relative to crowns (facial views).\\ne. When the incisal edges are aligned horizontally, cin-\\ngula of maxillary central incisors are off-center to \\nthe distal versus cingula of lateral incisors, which are \\ncentered (incisal views).\\nf. Mesial marginal ridges are longer than the distal \\nmarginal ridges (in central incisors due to the dis-\\ntally displaced cingulum and in lateral incisors due \\nto the cervical slope of the incisal edge to the distal) \\n(lingual views).\\ng. From the incisal view, when the crest of curvature of \\nthe cingulum is positioned directly downward, the \\nincisal edge of maxillary central incisors has a slight \\ndistolingual twist with the distoincisal corner more \\nlingual than the mesioincisal corner. The incisal \\nridges of maxillary lateral incisors run mesiodistally \\nwith no twist (incisal and mesial views).\\nh. Mesiodistal dimensions on central incisors are consid-\\nerably wider than faciolingual dimensions (rectangu-\\nlar shaped). On lateral incisors, these dimensions are \\nmore nearly equal (closer to square) (incisal views).\\nTYPE TRAITS THAT DISTINGUISH THE \\nMANDIBULAR CENTRAL INCISOR FROM \\nTHE MANDIBULAR LATERAL INCISOR\\nMandibular central incisors are very symmetrical versus \\nlateral incisors, which are not. The following are exam-\\nples of the relative lack of symmetry in lateral incisors:\\ni. Mandibular lateral incisors have the distal proximal \\ncontacts more apical than the mesial contacts. Central \\nincisor contacts are at the same level (facial views).\\nj. Lateral incisors have the distoincisal angles more \\nrounded than the mesioincisal angles. On central \\nincisors the mesioincisal and distoincisal angles are \\nquite similar (facial views).\\nk. Incisal edges of lateral incisors have a slight distolin-\\ngual twist (relative to a line bisecting the cingulum). \\nCentral incisors have their incisal edges at right \\nangles (with no twist) to this bisecting line (incisal \\nand mesial views).\\nl. The crowns of the mandibular lateral incisor tip \\nslightly to the distal relative to the root (facial views).\\nARCH TRAITS THAT DISTINGUISH \\nMAXILLARY FROM MANDIBULAR \\nINCISORS\\nm. Lingual fossae are more pronounced on maxillary \\nincisors (often with a lingual pit, especially on the \\nmaxillary lateral incisor). Mandibular incisors have \\nsmoother lingual anatomy without grooves and pits \\n(lingual views).\\nn. Maxillary incisors have roots that are closer to round \\nin cross-section. Mandibular incisors have roots that \\nare more ribbon-like (that is, are thin mesiodistally \\nand much wider faciolingually). Compare proximal \\nviews to facial views.\\no. Incisal edges of maxillary incisors are often labial to \\nthe root axis line. Mandibular incisal edges are often \\nlingual to the root axis line (proximal views).\\np. Mandibular crowns are smaller and narrower mesi-\\nodistally relative to the length compared to maxillary \\nincisors, which are relatively wider (facial views).\\nq.

Primary maxillary central incisors are the ONLY type \\nof incisors, primary or permanent, where the crown \\nis wider mesiodistally than incisocervically (facial \\nviews).\\nf. Primary incisor crowns are shorter relative to the \\nroot length compared to permanent teeth (facial \\nviews).\\ng. Primary maxillary canines are about as wide mesi-\\nodistally as they are long incisogingivally. Mandibular \\ncanines are longer incisocervically and narrower \\nmesiodistally (facial views).\\nh. Primary mandibular canines have their distal cusp \\nridges longer than their mesial cusp ridges (as do all \\npermanent canines and premolars EXCEPT perma-\\nnent maxillary first premolars) (facial views). Primary \\nmaxillary canines have their mesial cusp ridges lon-\\nger than the distal cusp ridges (which is UNIQUE to \\nonly this tooth and maxillary first premolars).\\ni. Primary maxillary canines have mesial proximal \\ncontacts more cervical than the distal (which is \\nUNIQUE to this tooth and permanent mandibular \\nfirst premolars) (facial views). All other primary and \\npermanent teeth have the distal contact area more \\ncervically located than on the mesial.'),\n",

Primary molars crowns are wider mesiodistally and \\nshorter cervico-occlusally, as on permanent molars \\n(buccal views).\\nb. Primary first molars are decidedly smaller than \\nprimary second molars compared to permanent or \\nsecondary molars, where the first molars are larger \\n(compare all views, not labeled as “b”).\\nc. Primary molar crowns have a narrow chewing sur-\\nface, or occlusal table, buccolingually compared to \\nthe entire tooth width buccolingually (proximal \\nviews).\\nd. Buccal cusps are not sharp; cusp ridges meet at a \\nwide (obtuse) angle (buccal views).\\ne. Buccal cervical ridges are prominent, especially \\nmesially (proximal views), so the facial cervical lines \\ncurve more apically in the mesial half of the buccal \\nsurface (buccal views).\\nf. Root furcations are nearer to the crown with little or \\nno root trunk compared to secondary molars (buccal \\nviews).\\ng. Roots are thin, slender, and widely spread (buccal \\nviews).\\nADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE \\nTO PRIMARY MAXILLARY SECOND MOLARS \\n(WHICH MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLE \\nTHE PERMANENT MAXILLARY FIRST \\nMOLARS)\\nh. Mesiolingual corner of the occlusal surface is com-\\npressed toward the distal (occlusal views).\\ni. Primary mesiobuccal cusp is about equal in size to \\nthe mesiolingual cusp compared to permanent or \\nsecondary teeth, where the mesiolingual cusp is \\nlarger than the mesiobuccal cusp (occlusal views).\\nADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE \\nTO PRIMARY MANDIBULAR SECOND \\nMOLARS (WHICH MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLE \\nTHE PERMANENT MANDIBULAR FIRST \\nMOLARS)\\nj. The three buccal cusps are of nearly equal size ver-\\nsus permanent first molars, where the distal cusp is \\nusually considerably smaller (occlusal views).\\nADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO \\nPRIMARY MAXILLARY FIRST MOLARS (WHICH, \\nFROM THE OCCLUSAL VIEW, SOMEWHAT \\nRESEMBLE PERMANENT MAXILLARY \\nPREMOLARS)\\nk. There are often four cusps: two larger cusps (like a \\nmaxillary premolar), the mesiobuccal cusp (1) wid-\\nest and longest and the mesiolingual cusp (2) the \\nsmaller but sharpest; and two smaller cusps, the \\ndistobuccal (3) and the inconspicuous, sometimes \\nabsent, distolingual (4) (occlusal views; see corre-\\nsponding numbered cusps).\\nl. A notch (distal to center) divides the large mesiobuc-\\ncal cusp from the indistinct distobuccal cusp (buccal \\nviews).\\nm. The crown is wider faciolingually than mesiodistally \\nlike a maxillary premolar (occlusal views).\\nn. The mesial marginal ridge is directed distolingually \\n(occlusal views).\\no. There are three fossae: a large mesial triangular \\nfossa, a medium central fossa, and a minute distal \\nfossa (occlusal views).\\np. The grooves form an “H” pattern (somewhat similar \\nto a maxillary premolar) (not labeled with a letter; \\nseen on occlusal views).\\nADDITIONAL UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS \\nOF PRIMARY MANDIBULAR FIRST MOLARS \\n(RESEMBLING NO OTHER TOOTH)\\nq. The mesial marginal ridge is overdeveloped, almost \\nresembling a cusp (buccal and occlusal views).\\nr. The occlusal table is wider mesiodistally than bucco-\\nlingually like secondary mandibular molars (occlusal \\nviews).\\ns. The mesial surface converges to the lingual with \\nan acute and prominent mesiobuccal angle of the \\nocclusal table (occlusal views).\\nt. The mesiobuccal cusp is the largest and longest \\ncusp, covering nearly two thirds of the buccal sur-\\nface (occlusal views), but is not wide buccolingually \\n(occlusal views).\\nu. A pronounced transverse ridge runs between the \\nmesiobuccal and mesiolingual cusp (occlusal \\nviews).\\nv. The occlusal table is larger distal to the transverse \\nridge with a larger distal fossa and a smaller mesial \\ntriangular fossa (no central fossa) (occlusal views).'),\n",
